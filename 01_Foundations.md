# 01: Foundations - Mathematical and CS Fundamentals

A successful career in AI is built on a strong foundation of mathematics and computer science. Your Master's in Computer Engineering has likely exposed you to many of these topics, but a deep, intuitive understanding is crucial. This section provides a curated list of resources to solidify your knowledge.

## 1. Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is the mathematics of data. It's how machines "see" and process information. You need to be comfortable with the following concepts.

**Key Concepts:**
*   Vectors and Spaces
*   Matrices and Matrix Operations (multiplication, inverse, transpose)
*   Dot Product
*   Determinants
*   Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
*   Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

**Recommended Resources:**
*   **Course:** [Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra Course on MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/) - The gold standard for learning linear algebra.
*   **Book:** "Introduction to Linear Algebra" by Gilbert Strang.
*   **Visualizations:** [3Blue1Brown's Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) - A must-watch for building intuition.

## 2. Probability and Statistics

Machine learning is all about making predictions based on data, which is inherently uncertain. Probability and statistics are the tools to quantify this uncertainty.

**Key Concepts:**
*   Basic Probability Theory (sample spaces, events)
*   Conditional Probability and Bayes' Theorem
*   Random Variables (discrete and continuous)
*   Common Probability Distributions (Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, Gaussian/Normal)
*   Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation)
*   Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

**Recommended Resources:**
*   **Course:** [Stat 110: Probability on Harvard's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht6O2SoKASim) - A comprehensive and engaging course.
*   **Book:** "All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference" by Larry Wasserman.
*   **Online Textbook:** [Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/) - An interactive introduction to probability and statistics.

## 3. Calculus

Modern machine learning, especially deep learning, is powered by optimization. Calculus provides the tools to perform this optimization.

**Key Concepts:**
*   Derivatives and Partial Derivatives
*   The Chain Rule (the foundation of backpropagation)
*   Gradients
*   Multivariable Calculus concepts (integrals, limits)

**Recommended Resources:**
*   **Course:** [MIT Single Variable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/) and [Multivariable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/) on MIT OpenCourseWare.
*   **Visualizations:** [3Blue1Brown's Essence of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) - Again, excellent for intuition.

## 4. Computer Science Fundamentals

Your background in Computer Engineering is a huge asset here. Ensure you have a strong grasp of the following, as they are critical for writing efficient AI code and for passing technical interviews.

**Key Concepts:**
*   **Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees (Binary, Heaps), Graphs, Hash Tables.
*   **Algorithms:** Sorting (Quicksort, Mergesort), Searching (Binary Search), Graph Traversal (BFS, DFS), Dynamic Programming.
*   **Complexity Analysis:** Big-O Notation.

**Recommended Resources:**
*   **Book:** "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell - Not just for interviews, but a great way to practice these concepts.
*   **Online Platform:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) - Practice solving problems to sharpen your skills.

## 5. Python for AI/ML

Python is the lingua franca of machine learning. You need to be proficient in it.

**Key Concepts:**
*   Core Python syntax and data types.
*   Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.
*   Python's data science libraries: NumPy (for numerical operations), Pandas (for data manipulation), and Matplotlib/Seaborn (for plotting).

**Recommended Resources:**
*   **Course:** [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/lessons) by Dr. Charles Severance.
*   **Book:** "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney (the creator of Pandas).
*   **Practice:** Solve problems on platforms like HackerRank or LeetCode using Python.
