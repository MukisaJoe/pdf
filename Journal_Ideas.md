### Idea 1: Blockchain & IIoT

**Title:** *A Lightweight, Fault-Resilient Blockchain Architecture for Real-Time Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) Environments*

**Abstract:** The integration of blockchain technology into the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is hampered by the high computational and energy costs of traditional consensus mechanisms. This paper introduces a novel, lightweight blockchain architecture designed specifically for constrained IIoT environments. Our architecture utilizes a custom Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism with validator rotation, offline transaction handling, and smart auto-mining to ensure low-power, fault-resilient operation. We demonstrate the system's effectiveness through a real-world implementation using Raspberry Pi nodes and various industrial sensors (DHT22, flame sensors). The proposed system functions as a fully independent, real-time edge chain while maintaining Layer-2 interoperability with Ethereum and IPFS. Our results show a significant improvement in transaction throughput and energy efficiency compared to existing solutions, paving the way for wider adoption of blockchain in industrial settings.

**Introduction:** The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) promises to revolutionize manufacturing, supply chain management, and industrial automation. However, the vast amounts of data generated by IIoT devices raise significant concerns about data integrity, security, and trust. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable ledger, is a natural candidate for addressing these challenges. Unfortunately, existing blockchain solutions like Bitcoin and Ethereum are ill-suited for the resource-constrained nature of IIoT devices. Their Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms are computationally expensive and introduce significant latency, making them impractical for real-time industrial applications. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a lightweight blockchain architecture tailored for the unique demands of the IIoT.

**Related Works:** The application of blockchain to IoT has been explored by several researchers. Early work focused on adapting existing blockchains like Ethereum for IoT applications, but these approaches often struggled with scalability and cost. More recent research has explored lightweight consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Authority (PoA) and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) (e.g., IOTA). While these represent steps in the right direction, they often lack the specific features required for industrial applications, such as robust fault tolerance, offline transaction handling, and seamless interoperability with both legacy industrial systems and public blockchains. Our work is the first to combine a custom PoA mechanism with validator rotation, smart auto-mining, and a dedicated offline transaction handling protocol, all within a fully independent edge chain architecture.

### Idea 2: Federated Learning & Blockchain

**Title:** *Enhancing the Security of Federated Learning through Blockchain-based Validator Selection and Robust Aggregation*

**Abstract:** Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative machine learning without centralizing data, but it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks from malicious participants. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages blockchain technology to secure FL systems. We introduce two key innovations: 1) a novel, entropy-aware validator selection algorithm that identifies and rewards trustworthy participants, and 2) a custom aggregation method that combines the strengths of FedAvg, Median, and Krum under a blockchain-based consensus mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive simulations in a hostile environment with a high percentage of adversarial participants. Our results show that our approach significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of the global model compared to standard FL and other blockchain-based FL solutions.

**Introduction:** Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving paradigm for training machine learning models on decentralized data. However, the very decentralization that provides privacy also creates security vulnerabilities. Malicious participants can launch a variety of attacks, such as data poisoning and model poisoning, to degrade the performance of the global model or insert backdoors. While several robust aggregation methods have been proposed to mitigate these attacks, they often struggle in the face of sophisticated adversaries. This paper argues that a more holistic approach is needed, one that not only protects the aggregation process but also ensures the trustworthiness of the participants themselves. We propose a novel solution that uses blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent ecosystem for federated learning.

**Related Works:** The intersection of blockchain and federated learning is a burgeoning field of research. Some studies have proposed using blockchain to store and track model updates, while others have focused on using smart contracts to manage the FL process. However, most existing work relies on simple validator selection mechanisms (e.g., random selection) and standard aggregation methods. Our work introduces a more sophisticated approach, inspired by the principles of TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving), to address the fundamental contradiction between decentralization and security. Our entropy-aware validator selection algorithm is the first of its kind, and our custom aggregation method is specifically designed to work in synergy with the underlying blockchain consensus, providing a level of security that is not achievable with existing solutions.

### Idea 3: Model Compression

**Title:** *SmartQuant: A Hybrid, Entropy-Aware Quantization Framework for High-Performance, Low-Memory LLMs*

**Abstract:** The increasing size of Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant challenge to their deployment on resource-constrained devices. This paper introduces SmartQuant, a novel hybrid quantization framework that combines the strengths of several techniques to achieve significant model compression without sacrificing performance. SmartQuant utilizes an entropy-aware Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for layer pruning, a Directional Residual Quantization (DRQ) for weight compression, and the BitsAndBytes library for efficient 4-bit quantization. We evaluate SmartQuant on a range of popular LLMs, including TinyLLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma. Our results show that SmartQuant can reduce model size by up to 80% while maintaining perplexity and downstream task performance on par with the original models.

**Introduction:** The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their widespread adoption in a variety of applications. However, their massive size, often running into billions of parameters, makes them inaccessible for many use cases that require deployment on devices with limited memory and computational power. Quantization, the process of reducing the precision of a model's weights, has emerged as a promising technique for addressing this challenge. However, existing quantization methods often face a trade-off between compression ratio and performance. Aggressive quantization can lead to a significant drop in model accuracy. In this paper, we propose SmartQuant, a hybrid framework that intelligently combines multiple quantization techniques to navigate this trade-off more effectively.

**Related Works:** The field of model compression has seen a flurry of research in recent years. Techniques like pruning, knowledge distillation, and quantization have all been explored. Within quantization, popular methods include post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT). While effective, these methods often treat all layers of the model uniformly. Our work is inspired by the observation that different layers of an LLM have different sensitivities to quantization. SmartQuant is the first framework to use an entropy-aware PCA to identify and prune less important layers before applying a combination of DRQ and 4-bit quantization. This hybrid, layer-aware approach allows for a much more aggressive compression of the model without the catastrophic performance degradation seen in other methods.

### Idea 4: Educational AI

**Title:** *CandyMatch: A Novel Distillation Loss Function for Creating Small, Effective AI Tutors*

**Abstract:** The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as AI tutors holds immense promise, but their size and cost make them difficult to scale. Knowledge distillation, the process of training a smaller "student" model to mimic a larger "teacher" model, offers a potential solution. This paper introduces CandyMatch, a novel distillation loss function designed specifically for creating AI tutors. CandyMatch goes beyond simple output matching, encouraging the student model to learn the underlying reasoning process of the teacher by incorporating measures of task relevance and entropy weighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CandyMatch by using it to distill a Mistral-7B teacher model into a 1B parameter student model for a multi-agent AI tutoring system. Our results show that the CandyMatch-distilled student model significantly outperforms a student model distilled with a traditional loss function on a range of educational tasks.

**Introduction:** The vision of a personal AI tutor for every student is closer than ever, thanks to the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). These models can explain complex concepts, generate practice problems, and provide personalized feedback. However, the computational resources required to run these models make them inaccessible to many. Knowledge distillation offers a path towards democratizing AI education by creating smaller, more efficient models. The key challenge in knowledge distillation is designing a loss function that effectively transfers the "knowledge" from the teacher to the student. This is particularly important for educational applications, where it's not enough for the student to simply mimic the teacher's answers; it must also learn the underlying reasoning.

**Related Works:** Knowledge distillation has been successfully applied in a variety of domains. The most common approach is to use a loss function based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the teacher's and student's output distributions. While effective, this approach does not explicitly encourage the student to learn the teacher's reasoning process. More recent work has explored using attention-based methods to encourage the student to focus on the same parts of the input as the teacher. CandyMatch builds on these ideas but introduces two key innovations: 1) a task relevance metric that helps the student focus on the most important parts of the educational task, and 2) an entropy weighting mechanism that encourages the student to be more confident in its correct answers. This combination results in a student model that is not only smaller and faster but also a more effective AI tutor.

### Idea 5: ZKP & Fake News

**Title:** *NeuroZKP-ARX: An AI-Enhanced, Privacy-Preserving Architecture for Fake News Mitigation on a Decentralized Web*

**Abstract:** The proliferation of fake news on social media platforms poses a significant threat to democratic societies. This paper introduces NeuroZKP-ARX, a novel, AI-enhanced, and privacy-preserving architecture for detecting and mitigating the spread of fake news. Our system integrates a custom blockchain with Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) powered verification, IPFS for decentralized storage, and a real-time AI for claim validation. The NeuroZKP-ARX system allows users to flag potential fake news, have it verified by an AI model, and then have the verification result recorded on an immutable ledger, all without revealing the identity of the flagger or the verifier. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through a prototype implementation and a series of experiments. Our results show that NeuroZKP-ARX can accurately detect fake news with low latency while preserving user privacy.

**Introduction:** The digital age has democratized the creation and dissemination of information, but it has also created a fertile ground for the spread of fake news. Malicious actors can easily manipulate public opinion by spreading false or misleading information on a massive scale. Existing solutions, which often rely on centralized fact-checking organizations, are struggling to keep up with the sheer volume of new content. This paper proposes a new approach, one that combines the power of artificial intelligence with the security and privacy of blockchain and Zero-Knowledge Proofs. We envision a decentralized ecosystem where any user can flag potential fake news, and an AI model can provide a real-time, unbiased assessment of its veracity, all while protecting the privacy of everyone involved.

**Related Works:** The fight against fake news has attracted significant attention from the research community. AI-based approaches have focused on developing models that can automatically detect fake news based on its content, style, or propagation patterns. Blockchain-based approaches have focused on creating decentralized platforms for news verification, where users can stake tokens to vouch for the credibility of a story. Our work is the first to combine these two approaches in a synergistic way. By using ZKPs, we can leverage the power of AI for claim validation without creating a new centralized point of failure or compromising user privacy. The NeuroZKP-ARX system represents a significant step forward in the development of a more trustworthy and resilient information ecosystem.

### Idea 6: TRIZ & Research Methodology

**Title:** *TRIZ-Driven Innovation in Decentralized AI: A Methodological Framework and Case Studies*

**Abstract:** The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) is a powerful methodology for systematic innovation, yet its application in the field of computer science research remains limited. This paper proposes a methodological framework for applying TRIZ principles to drive innovation in the design of decentralized AI systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through two detailed case studies from our own research: 1) the use of TRIZ to resolve the security vs. efficiency contradiction in blockchain-based federated learning, and 2) the use of TRIZ to inspire novel, mathematically-grounded model compression techniques. Our findings suggest that TRIZ can be a valuable tool for researchers, helping them to identify and resolve fundamental contradictions in their work and to systematically generate inventive solutions.

**Introduction:** The design of decentralized AI systems is fraught with contradictions. We want our systems to be secure, but also efficient. We want them to be powerful, but also lightweight. We want them to be private, but also auditable. Traditional research methodologies often rely on ad-hoc, trial-and-error approaches to navigating these trade-offs. The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ), in contrast, offers a systematic and structured approach to innovation. Developed by Genrich Altshuller, TRIZ is based on the idea that inventive problems can be solved by identifying and resolving their underlying contradictions. This paper explores the application of this powerful methodology to the field of decentralized AI.

**Related Works:** While TRIZ has been widely adopted in engineering and product design, its application in computer science research is still in its infancy. A few studies have explored the use of TRIZ for software design, but there is a lack of research on its application to more fundamental research problems. Our work is the first to propose a comprehensive methodological framework for applying TRIZ to the design of decentralized AI systems. By providing a clear, step-by-step process and demonstrating its effectiveness through real-world case studies, we aim to encourage the wider adoption of TRIZ as a tool for driving innovation in computer science research.

### Idea 7: Model Compression & Mathematics

**Title:** *Cosine-Preserving Quantization: A Novel, Mathematically-Grounded Approach to LLM Compression*

**Abstract:** This paper introduces Cosine-Preserving Quantization (CPQ), a novel and mathematically-grounded approach to LLM compression. Inspired by the principles of TRIZ, CPQ leverages the properties of sine and cosine transforms to quantize model weights while preserving the directional information encoded in the model's embedding space. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of CPQ and demonstrate its effectiveness through a series of experiments on popular LLMs. Our results show that CPQ can achieve a higher compression ratio than existing methods while maintaining or even improving performance on tasks that rely on semantic similarity.

**Introduction:** The ability of LLMs to understand and generate human language is rooted in their ability to represent words and sentences as vectors in a high-dimensional embedding space. The geometric relationships between these vectors, particularly the cosine similarity, capture the semantic relationships between the corresponding words and sentences. Existing quantization methods, however, are often agnostic to this geometric structure, leading to a loss of semantic information and a degradation in model performance. This paper proposes a new approach to quantization, one that is explicitly designed to preserve the cosine similarity between embedding vectors.

**Related Works:** The problem of preserving geometric structure in dimensionality reduction has a long history in machine learning. Techniques like t-SNE and UMAP are designed to preserve the local or global structure of data when embedding it in a lower-dimensional space. However, the application of these ideas to model quantization is a relatively new area of research. Our work is the first to propose a quantization method that is explicitly designed to preserve cosine similarity. By grounding our approach in the mathematics of sine and cosine transforms, we are able to develop a method that is not only effective but also theoretically well-founded.

### Idea 8: Educational AI & Multilinguality

**Title:** *Building a Modular, Multilingual AI Tutoring System for Under-Resourced Languages: A Case Study in Luganda-English Education*

**Abstract:** The benefits of AI-powered education are not yet accessible to speakers of many of the world's languages. This paper presents a case study in the development of a modular, multilingual AI tutoring system for an under-resourced language pair: Luganda and English. We detail the challenges of building such a system, from the lack of training data to the need for culturally-relevant pedagogical strategies. We then present our solutions, including a novel approach to data augmentation, a modular architecture that allows for the easy integration of new language pairs, and a user-friendly interface designed in collaboration with a community of Luganda-speaking students and educators. Our findings provide a roadmap for other researchers and practitioners who are working to make AI education more equitable and accessible.

**Introduction:** The digital language divide is a major barrier to global educational equity. While speakers of high-resource languages like English have access to a growing number of AI-powered learning tools, speakers of under-resourced languages are being left behind. This paper addresses this challenge by documenting our experience in building a modular, multilingual AI tutoring system for Luganda and English. Luganda, a Bantu language spoken primarily in Uganda, is a prime example of an under-resourced language with a vibrant community of speakers who could benefit from AI-powered educational tools.

**Related Works:** The field of natural language processing (NLP) for under-resourced languages has made significant strides in recent years. Techniques like transfer learning and cross-lingual embeddings have made it possible to build NLP models for languages with limited training data. However, the application of these techniques to the development of AI tutoring systems is still a new and challenging area of research. Our work is one of the first to provide a comprehensive case study of the development of an AI tutoring system for an under-resourced African language. By openly sharing our methodology, our code, and our findings, we hope to accelerate progress in this important and under-served area of research.

### Idea 9: Blockchain & System Design

**Title:** *A Comparative Analysis of Blockchain Platforms for Decentralized AI: A Performance and Resilience Benchmark*

**Abstract:** The choice of a blockchain platform is a critical design decision for any decentralized AI application. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of four leading blockchain platforms for this purpose: Hyperledger Fabric, Quorum, IOTA, and Ethereum. We evaluate the performance and resilience of each platform on a standardized federated learning workload. Our benchmark includes metrics such as transaction throughput, latency, cost, and resilience to common adversarial attacks. Our findings provide a detailed and nuanced picture of the strengths and weaknesses of each platform, offering valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners who are designing the next generation of decentralized AI systems.

**Introduction:** The convergence of blockchain and AI has the potential to create a new generation of intelligent, decentralized, and trustworthy systems. However, the rapid proliferation of blockchain platforms has made it difficult for researchers and practitioners to choose the right tool for the job. Each platform has its own unique architecture, consensus mechanism, and performance characteristics. This paper aims to bring clarity to this complex landscape by providing a rigorous and objective benchmark of four of the most promising platforms for decentralized AI.

**Related Works:** While there have been several studies that have benchmarked the performance of individual blockchain platforms, there is a lack of research that has specifically focused on their suitability for decentralized AI applications. Our work is the first to provide a head-to-head comparison of Hyperledger Fabric, Quorum, IOTA, and Ethereum on a standardized federated learning workload. By using a consistent methodology and a comprehensive set of metrics, we are able to provide a more accurate and insightful comparison than has been previously available.

### Idea 10: Full-Stack System Building

**Title:** *From Theory to Production: A Case Study in the Full-Stack Development of a Modular AI Tutoring System*

**Abstract:** The journey from a research idea to a production-grade system is often long and arduous. This paper provides a detailed case study of the full-stack development of a modular AI tutoring system. We document our entire process, from the initial theoretical work on model distillation to the implementation of a scalable and user-friendly web and mobile interface. We discuss the challenges we faced and the solutions we developed at each stage of the development process, including our choice of a tech stack (React, FastAPI, Flask, and Flutter), our approach to system architecture, and our strategy for user testing and deployment. This paper provides a rare and valuable look into the practical realities of building and deploying a complex AI system.

**Introduction:** Much of the academic literature on AI focuses on the theoretical aspects of model development and training. There is a comparative lack of research that documents the equally important process of building and deploying these models in the real world. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive case study of the full-stack development of a modular AI tutoring system. We believe that by sharing our experiences, we can help to bridge the gap between theory and practice and provide a valuable resource for other researchers who are embarking on the challenging but rewarding journey of building real-world AI systems.

**Related Works:** The "systems" track at major AI conferences has become an increasingly popular venue for papers that focus on the practical aspects of building and deploying AI systems. However, many of these papers still focus on a narrow slice of the development process. Our work is unique in its scope, covering the entire full-stack development process, from the backend AI models to the frontend user interface. By providing a holistic view of the development process, we hope to provide a more complete and useful resource for the AI community.

### Idea 11: Blockchain & IoT Security

**Title:** *Smart Auto-Mining: A Novel Consensus Mechanism for Energy-Efficient and Secure IIoT Blockchain Networks*

**Abstract:** This paper introduces Smart Auto-Mining, a novel consensus mechanism designed to address the energy efficiency and security challenges of IIoT blockchain networks. Smart Auto-Mining dynamically adjusts the mining difficulty based on network conditions and the trustworthiness of participants, as determined by a reputation system. This allows the network to conserve energy during periods of low activity while maintaining a high level of security during periods of high activity or in the presence of adversarial attacks. We implement Smart Auto-Mining in our custom lightweight blockchain architecture and evaluate its performance through a series of simulations and a real-world deployment. Our results show that Smart Auto-Mining can reduce energy consumption by up to 60% compared to a standard PoA mechanism, without compromising the security or fault-resilience of the network.

**Introduction:** The need for a secure and efficient consensus mechanism is one of the biggest roadblocks to the widespread adoption of blockchain in IIoT. PoW is too energy-intensive, while PoS can be vulnerable to centralization. PoA is a promising alternative, but it often relies on a static set of validators, which can be a single point of failure. This paper proposes a new approach, Smart Auto-Mining, which dynamically adjusts the mining process to optimize for both energy efficiency and security.

**Related Works:** Research on lightweight consensus mechanisms for IoT has explored a variety of approaches, from PoA and PoS to DAGs and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). However, most of these approaches have focused on optimizing for a single metric, such as throughput or energy efficiency. Smart Auto-Mining is the first mechanism to dynamically balance the competing demands of energy efficiency and security. By integrating a reputation system into the consensus process, we are able to create a more intelligent and adaptive network that is better suited for the dynamic and often hostile environments of the IIoT.

### Idea 12: Federated Learning & Game Theory

**Title:** *A Game-Theoretic Approach to Validator Selection in Blockchain-Based Federated Learning*

**Abstract:** This paper models the validator selection process in blockchain-based federated learning as a non-cooperative game. We analyze the strategic interactions between participants, who can choose to be honest or malicious, and the network, which must select a set of validators to produce the next block. We show that in a standard FL setting, there can be a Nash equilibrium where it is rational for participants to be malicious. We then propose a novel, game-theoretic validator selection algorithm that incentivizes honest behavior by rewarding trustworthy participants and punishing malicious ones. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results show that our algorithm can significantly increase the percentage of honest participants in the network and improve the accuracy and robustness of the global model.

**Introduction:** The security of federated learning is a classic collective action problem. While all participants would benefit from a secure and accurate global model, each individual participant has an incentive to act maliciously to either sabotage the model or gain an unfair advantage. This paper uses the tools of game theory to formally analyze this problem and to design a validator selection mechanism that can overcome it.

**Related Works:** Game theory has been used to analyze a wide range of problems in computer science, from network routing to resource allocation. In the context of blockchain, game theory has been used to analyze the security of consensus mechanisms and the economics of cryptocurrency mining. Our work is the first to apply game theory to the problem of validator selection in blockchain-based federated learning. By formally modeling the strategic interactions between participants, we are able to gain a deeper understanding of the security challenges and to design a more effective and robust solution.

### Idea 13: Model Compression & Hardware

**Title:** *Directional Entropy-Aware Quantization (DEAQ): A Hardware-Friendly Compression Technique for LLMs*

**Abstract:** This paper introduces Directional Entropy-Aware Quantization (DEAQ), a novel compression technique for LLMs that is specifically designed to be hardware-friendly. DEAQ uses a directional entropy-aware metric to identify the most important weights in a model and then applies a more aggressive quantization to the less important weights. This allows for a high compression ratio without a significant loss in performance. Crucially, the DEAQ algorithm is designed to be easily implemented in hardware, with a low memory footprint and a regular computational structure. We provide a detailed analysis of the hardware implementation of DEAQ and demonstrate its effectiveness on a custom FPGA accelerator.

**Introduction:** The deployment of LLMs on edge devices is limited not only by the size of the models but also by the energy consumption of the hardware required to run them. While existing compression techniques can reduce the size of the model, they often result in irregular data structures that are difficult to process efficiently in hardware. This paper proposes a new compression technique, DEAQ, that is co-designed with the underlying hardware architecture.

**Related Works:** The co-design of hardware and software has a long history in computer architecture. In the context of deep learning, there has been a growing interest in developing hardware accelerators that are specifically designed for a particular type of model or algorithm. Our work is the first to propose a compression technique that is co-designed with a custom hardware accelerator. By considering the constraints of the hardware from the very beginning, we are able to develop a compression technique that is not only effective but also highly efficient.

### Idea 14: Educational AI & User Experience

**Title:** *A User-Centered Design Process for a Multi-Agent AI Tutoring System*

**Abstract:** The success of an AI tutoring system depends not only on the quality of its AI models but also on the quality of its user experience (UX). This paper presents a detailed case study of the user-centered design process for a multi-agent AI tutoring system. We document our entire process, from initial user research and persona development to a multi-stage usability testing process. We discuss the key design decisions we made and the impact they had on the final system. Our findings provide a set of best practices for designing and evaluating the UX of AI tutoring systems.

**Introduction:** The field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has a long history of developing methods for designing and evaluating user interfaces. However, the application of these methods to the design of AI-powered systems is still a new and challenging area of research. This is particularly true for AI tutoring systems, where the user experience is critical to the system's educational effectiveness. This paper provides a practical guide for researchers and practitioners who are working to design AI tutoring systems that are not only intelligent but also usable, engaging, and effective.

**Related Works:** The field of AI in education has traditionally focused on the a
development of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). While these systems have become increasingly sophisticated, they have often been criticized for their poor user interfaces. More recent research has started to focus on the user experience of AI tutoring systems, but there is still a lack of research that provides a detailed and comprehensive account of the user-centered design process. Our work is one of the first to provide a complete case study of the user-centered design of a multi-agent AI tutoring system.

### Idea 15: ZKP & Scalability

**Title:** *Scaling ZKP-based Verification for Fake News Mitigation: A Performance Analysis and Optimization*

**Abstract:** The use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for fake news verification is a promising approach, but its scalability is a major concern. This paper provides a detailed performance analysis of a ZKP-based fake news verification system. We identify the key performance bottlenecks and then propose a series of optimizations to improve the system's scalability. Our optimizations include a more efficient ZKP generation algorithm, a parallel verification process, and a caching mechanism for frequently verified claims. Our results show that our optimizations can improve the throughput of the system by up to 10x, making it a more practical solution for real-world deployment.

**Introduction:** The ability to verify the authenticity of information without revealing its source is one of the most powerful features of Zero-Knowledge Proofs. This makes them an ideal tool for building privacy-preserving fake news verification systems. However, the computational overhead of ZKPs can be a major barrier to their adoption. This paper addresses this challenge by providing a detailed performance analysis of a ZKP-based verification system and a set of optimizations to improve its scalability.

**Related Works:** The field of ZKP research has made tremendous progress in recent years, with the development of new and more efficient proof systems. However, much of this research has focused on the theoretical aspects of ZKP design. There is a lack of research that has focused on the practical aspects of deploying ZKP-based systems at scale. Our work is one of the first to provide a detailed performance analysis and optimization of a ZKP-based system for a real-world application.

### Idea 16: Creative Writing & AI

**Title:** *The Man I Met on the Way to the Sea: An Exploration of Human-AI Collaboration in Spiritual Writing*

**Abstract:** This paper presents a case study in the use of AI as a collaborative partner in the process of spiritual writing. The author, a computer engineering PhD student, documents his experience in writing a book of spiritual poetry, "The Man I Met on the Way to the Sea," with the help of a large language model. The paper explores the philosophical and theological implications of human-AI collaboration in a creative and spiritual context. It also provides a practical guide for other writers who are interested in using AI as a tool for their own creative and spiritual exploration.

**Introduction:** The rise of large language models has opened up new possibilities for human-AI collaboration in a wide range of creative fields. This paper explores one such possibility: the use of AI as a collaborative partner in the process of spiritual writing. The author shares his personal journey of writing a book of spiritual poetry with the help of an AI, reflecting on the ways in which the AI both helped and hindered his creative process. The paper argues that AI can be a powerful tool for spiritual exploration, but only if it is used with intention, discernment, and a deep understanding of its limitations.

**Related Works:** The intersection of AI and creativity is a rapidly growing field of research. Much of this research has focused on the use of AI to generate art, music, and literature. There is a comparative lack of research that has explored the use of AI as a collaborative partner in the creative process. Our work is one of the first to provide a detailed and personal account of human-AI collaboration in a spiritual writing context.

### Idea 17: Interdisciplinary Research

**Title:** *The Interdisciplinary Mind: A Case Study of a Research Portfolio Spanning AI, Blockchain, and Educational Technology*

**Abstract:** This paper presents a case study of an interdisciplinary research portfolio that spans the fields of AI, blockchain, and educational technology. The author, a computer engineering PhD student, reflects on the challenges and opportunities of working at the intersection of multiple disciplines. The paper argues that interdisciplinary research is essential for solving the complex challenges of the 21st century, but that it also requires a unique set of skills and a different approach to research. The paper provides a set of practical recommendations for other researchers who are interested in pursuing interdisciplinary research.

**Introduction:** The traditional academic disciplines are no longer sufficient to address the complex and interconnected challenges of the 21st century. From climate change to global pandemics to the spread of fake news, the problems we face require a more holistic and interdisciplinary approach. This paper provides a personal account of the challenges and rewards of pursuing interdisciplinary research as a PhD student.

**Related Works:** The call for more interdisciplinary research is not new. However, there is a lack of research that has provided a detailed and personal account of what it is like to do interdisciplinary research as a PhD student. Our work is one of the first to provide such an account. By sharing our experiences, we hope to inspire and encourage other young researchers to pursue their own interdisciplinary passions.

### Idea 18: Blockchain & Edge Computing

**Title:** *Real-Time Edge Chain: A Novel Blockchain Architecture for Time-Critical IIoT Applications*

**Abstract:** This paper introduces Real-Time Edge Chain (RTEC), a novel blockchain architecture designed for time-critical IIoT applications. RTEC combines a lightweight consensus mechanism with a two-tier architecture, consisting of a real-time edge chain and a more traditional master chain. The edge chain is responsible for processing time-sensitive transactions with low latency, while the master chain provides a more secure and immutable record of the network's state. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RTEC through a prototype implementation and a series of experiments. Our results show that RTEC can achieve a significant reduction in latency compared to existing blockchain solutions, without sacrificing security or decentralization.

**Introduction:** The IIoT is characterized by a growing number of applications that require real-time data processing. From industrial control systems to autonomous vehicles, the ability to process data with low latency is critical for the safety and reliability of these systems. Existing blockchain solutions, however, are not well-suited for these time-critical applications. The latency introduced by their consensus mechanisms can be unacceptably high. This paper proposes a new blockchain architecture, RTEC, that is specifically designed to address this challenge.

**Related Works:** The problem of blockchain scalability has been the subject of intense research in recent years. Layer-2 solutions like state channels and sidechains have been proposed to improve the throughput and reduce the latency of blockchain networks. Our work is inspired by these ideas, but it is the first to propose a two-tier architecture that is specifically designed for time-critical IIoT applications. By combining a real-time edge chain with a more traditional master chain, we are able to achieve the best of both worlds: low latency for time-sensitive transactions and high security for the overall network.

### Idea 19: AI & Ethics

**Title:** *The Ethics of Decentralized AI: A Framework for Responsible Innovation*

**Abstract:** The rise of decentralized AI systems, powered by technologies like blockchain and federated learning, raises a new set of ethical challenges. How do we ensure fairness, accountability, and transparency in systems that are not controlled by a single entity? This paper proposes a framework for responsible innovation in decentralized AI. Our framework is based on a set of core principles, including privacy, security, fairness, and explainability. We provide a set of practical guidelines for researchers and practitioners who are working to design and build decentralized AI systems that are not only powerful but also ethical.

**Introduction:** The ethical challenges of AI have been the subject of intense debate in recent years. Much of this debate, however, has focused on centralized AI systems that are controlled by large corporations or governments. The rise of decentralized AI systems raises a new and even more complex set of ethical challenges. This paper provides a starting point for a much-needed conversation about the ethics of decentralized AI.

**Related Works:** The field of AI ethics has produced a number of frameworks and guidelines for responsible AI development. However, most of these frameworks have been designed for centralized AI systems. Our work is one of the first to propose a framework that is specifically tailored for the unique ethical challenges of decentralized AI.

### Idea 20: Technology & Faith

**Title:** *Digital Evangelism: A New Model for Faith-Based Communication in the 21st Century*

**Abstract:** This paper explores the use of technology and art for digital evangelism. The author, a computer engineering PhD student and a spiritual writer, shares his experience in using a combination of engraving-style t-shirts, a personal blog, and social media to communicate a message of faith and healing. The paper argues that digital evangelism requires a new model of communication, one that is more personal, authentic, and relational than traditional forms of evangelism. The paper provides a set of practical recommendations for other faith-based communicators who are interested in using technology to share their message with the world.

**Introduction:** The internet has transformed the way we communicate, and the church is still struggling to catch up. Traditional models of evangelism, which often rely on one-way communication from a pulpit or a printing press, are no longer as effective as they once were. This paper proposes a new model of digital evangelism, one that is more suited for the interactive and relational nature of the internet.

**Related Works:** The intersection of faith and technology is a growing area of interest for both scholars and practitioners. Much of this work, however, has focused on the use of technology for church administration or online worship services. There is a comparative lack of research that has explored the use of technology for evangelism. Our work is one of the first to propose a new model of digital evangelism that is grounded in both theological reflection and practical experience.
