# Lecture 2.2: How to Question AI Outputs (Prompt as Interrogation, Not Instruction)

### Introduction: Changing Your Mental Model
Most people approach AI with a simple "instruction" mindset. We ask it to "write," "summarize," or "explain." To unlock a deeper level of reasoning, we must shift this mental model from **instruction** to **interrogation**.

Think of yourself not as a user giving a command, but as a detective interrogating a highly knowledgeable, but not necessarily wise, witness. The AI has access to vast information, but it's your job to extract the truth, uncover hidden biases, and test the strength of its claims. The quality of the answers you get depends directly on the quality of your interrogation.

### From Passive Instruction to Active Interrogation

Let's compare the two approaches with an example.

**The Instruction Mindset (Passive):**
> "Write an essay about the causes of the American Revolution."

This prompt is passive. It offloads the thinking to the AI. The result will likely be a generic, surface-level summary.

**The Interrogation Mindset (Active):**
> "I am studying the causes of the American Revolution. I want you to act as a historian.
> 1.  First, identify the three most influential schools of thought regarding the primary causes (e.g., economic, political, ideological).
> 2.  For each school of thought, name a key proponent historian.
> 3.  Finally, for each, describe the primary evidence they use to support their claims.
> Present this in a structured table."

This prompt is an active interrogation. It forces the AI to structure its knowledge, provide evidence, and expose its sources, giving you much richer and more reliable material to work with.

### A Framework for Interrogation: The 5 W's for AI
Use this framework to systematically question any AI output.

*   **Who? (Provenance and Bias)**
    *   *Good Questions:* "Which sources or authors are most influential in shaping this answer?" "What viewpoints might be underrepresented here?" "Whose perspective is missing?"

*   **What? (Evidence and Counterarguments)**
    *   *Good Questions:* "What is the specific evidence supporting that claim?" "What is the strongest counterargument to this position?" "How would you define the term '[key concept]' in this context?"

*   **When? (Timeliness and Historical Context)**
    *   *Good Questions:* "Is this information still current?" "In what historical context did this idea originally emerge, and how has it changed over time?"

*   **Where? (Scope and Applicability)**
    *   *Good Questions:* "Is this a universally held view, or is it specific to a particular culture or region (e.g., a Western perspective)?" "Where would this solution be most and least applicable?"

*   **Why? (Causality and Assumptions)**
    *   *Good Questions:* "Why is this considered the most important factor over others?" "What are the fundamental assumptions that this argument rests on?"

### Practical Interrogation Techniques

*   **Assign a Role:** "Act as a skeptical economist and critique this business plan." This forces the AI to adopt a specific lens and persona.
*   **Request a Rubric:** "Create a rubric for a high-quality answer to my question. Then, answer the question according to that rubric." This makes the AI define its own standards of quality before answering.
*   **Force a "Steelman":** "What is the strongest, most charitable version of the argument *against* your own conclusion?" This is the opposite of a straw man and a powerful way to uncover weaknesses.

### Conclusion
Shifting from instruction to interrogation is the single most important skill for reasoning effectively with AI. It transforms the AI from a passive "answer box" into an active "thinking partner" that you can guide, challenge, and ultimately use to sharpen your own mind.
