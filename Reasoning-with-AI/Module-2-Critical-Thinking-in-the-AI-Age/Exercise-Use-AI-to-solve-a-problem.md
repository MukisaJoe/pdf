# Exercise: Use AI to Solve a Problem → Critique → Refine

### Objective
To put the "interrogation" framework into practice. In this exercise, you will use an AI to solve a real-world problem, critically evaluate its first attempt, and then use iterative refinement to co-create a high-quality, actionable solution.

---

### Step 1: Choose Your Problem
Select a practical, multi-step problem that requires some planning and detail. Avoid simple, factual questions.

**Choose one of the following, or create your own:**
*   "Plan a 5-day, healthy meal plan for a busy professional on a budget."
*   "Create a 3-month workout schedule for a beginner who wants to run a 5k race."
*   "Outline a social media marketing strategy for a new, independent coffee shop."
*   "Design a weekend project to build a simple weather-monitoring station using a Raspberry Pi."

---

### Step 2: The Initial Prompt (The Instruction)
First, approach the AI with a simple, high-level instruction. Don't give it too much detail.

*   **Example prompt:** "Give me a workout plan to run a 5k."
*   Copy and paste your simple prompt into your chosen AI.
*   **Save the AI's complete, unedited response. This is your "Version 1."**

---

### Step 3: Critique the "Version 1" Result
Look at the AI's first attempt. It will likely be generic and full of unstated assumptions. Analyze its weaknesses using these guiding questions:

*   **What crucial information is missing?** (e.g., For the workout plan, what's my current fitness level? How many days a week can I train? Do I have access to a gym?)
*   **What assumptions did the AI make?** (e.g., It might have assumed you are a complete beginner, or that you can train 5 days a week).
*   **How practical is this plan?** Is it realistic for your life? Does it lack the specific detail needed to actually execute it?

---

### Step 4: The Refinement Loop (The Interrogation)
This is the core of the exercise. Your goal is to improve the initial plan by providing context, questioning assumptions, and demanding specifics. Engage the AI in a conversation.

Here is a checklist of interrogation techniques to try. Use them to refine your initial plan.

*   **Provide Essential Context:**
    *   "I am a complete beginner with a busy schedule. I can only train 3 days a week (Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday). I have access to running shoes but no gym. Please revise the 5k training plan with this in mind."

*   **Question Its Choices:**
    *   "You suggested 'interval training.' Why is this better for a beginner than just jogging? What are the specific benefits?"

*   **Demand Specifics and Actionable Detail:**
    *   "For the Week 1 'long run,' please define what 'long' means. Should it be 1 mile, 10 minutes? Be specific. Also, provide a 5-minute warm-up routine and a 5-minute cool-down stretch routine to do for each workout."

*   **Ask for a "Pre-Mortem" (Anticipate Problems):**
    *   "What are the two most common mistakes a beginner makes with this plan that could lead to injury? How can I avoid them?"

*   **Request Alternative Options:**
    *   "What is an alternative workout I can do on a rainy day if I cannot run outside?"

---

### Step 5: Compare "Version 1" with "Version Final"
Place the initial, generic plan side-by-side with your final, refined plan. The difference should be dramatic.

**Reflect on this:**
*   How much better is the final plan? Is it now a personalized, actionable strategy rather than a generic document?
*   How much of that improvement came directly from the AI's knowledge, and how much came from *your* ability to guide, question, and direct it?

### Conclusion
This exercise proves that the value of an AI is unlocked through iteration. The first answer is rarely the best answer. Effective reasoning with AI is a collaborative process where the human's critical thinking and contextual knowledge guides the AI's powerful generative capabilities to produce a truly useful result.
