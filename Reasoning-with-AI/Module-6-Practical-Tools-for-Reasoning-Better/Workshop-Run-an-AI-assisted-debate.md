# Workshop: Run an AI-Assisted Debate

### Objective
To put the "AI as a Debate Partner" technique into practice. In this workshop, you will engage in a structured debate with an AI on a complex topic. The goal is not to "win," but to experience firsthand how AI can be used to challenge your assumptions, introduce new perspectives, and ultimately strengthen your own ability to reason and argue effectively.

### Part 1: Choose Your Topic and Stance (10 minutes)
1.  Choose **one** of the following debatable topics:
    *   **Topic A:** Is a four-day work week a viable and beneficial future for most modern industries?
    *   **Topic B:** Should social media companies be held legally responsible for the spread of misinformation on their platforms?
    *   **Topic C:** Is the pursuit of space colonization a necessary long-term goal for humanity, or is it an irresponsible distraction from Earth's problems?

2.  Decide which side of the issue you will argue for: **PRO** (in favor of the proposal) or **CON** (against the proposal).

### Part 2: The Opening Statements (15 minutes)

1.  **Your Opening Statement:** Before engaging the AI, take 10 minutes to write your own opening statement for your chosen side. It should be 2-3 paragraphs long and should outline your main arguments. This step is crucial for capturing your own initial, uninfluenced thoughts.

2.  **The AI's Opening Statement:** Now, prompt the AI to take the opposing side and deliver its opening statement. Use the prompt below, filling in your chosen topic and stance.

    **Example Prompt:**
    > "Let's have a formal debate. The topic is: '[Insert your chosen topic here].'
    >
    > I will be arguing [PRO/CON - *state your chosen side*].
    > You will be arguing the opposite side, [CON/PRO - *state the AI's side*].
    >
    > Please begin by delivering your opening statement. Present at least three distinct and well-reasoned arguments for your position."

### Part 3: The Rebuttal Round (20 minutes)

Now, your main task: you must write a rebuttal to the AI's opening statement. The goal is to engage directly and critically with the points the AI has raised.

To help you structure your rebuttal, consider these questions as you analyze the AI's argument:
*   **What is its strongest point?** Don't ignore it. How can you challenge the underlying assumption of its strongest argument?
*   **What evidence does it use?** Is the evidence strong and relevant? Can you offer counter-evidence or a different interpretation of its data?
*   **Did it commit any logical fallacies?** Did it create a straw man, make a false analogy, or appeal to popularity? Call it out directly in your rebuttal.
*   **What did it fail to consider?** What important nuance, value, or potential consequence did its argument ignore?

Write a 2-3 paragraph rebuttal that directly addresses the AI's points.

*(Optional)*: Once you have written your rebuttal, you can ask the AI to write a rebuttal to *your* original opening statement to see how it would have challenged your initial points.

### Part 4: Synthesis and Reflection (15 minutes)

After the debate, take a few minutes to reflect on the process.

**Answer these questions for yourself:**
1.  Did the AI introduce any arguments or perspectives you had not previously considered?
2.  In what ways did engaging with the AI's "thinking" force you to refine, clarify, or strengthen your own arguments?
3.  Has your opinion on the topic changed, or has it become more nuanced?
4.  How could you use this technique in your professional or academic life to prepare for a real-life debate, a critical presentation, or an important negotiation?

### Conclusion
The goal of an AI-assisted debate is not to win against the machine, but to **win a deeper understanding for yourself.** By using AI as a dedicated sparring partner, we can break out of our own echo chambers, pressure-test our beliefs, and develop a more sophisticated and robust understanding of any complex issue. It is a powerful method for transforming the AI from a simple "answer-box" into a true "reasoning-sharpener."
