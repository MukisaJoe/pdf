# Workshop: Compare AI-generated answers with human reasoning

### Objective
To critically analyze the differences between AI-generated and human-generated responses to the same prompt. This workshop will help you identify the unique strengths and weaknesses of each form of reasoning, focusing on depth, bias, and contextual awareness.

---

### Part 1: The Prompt
We will use a classic ethical dilemma that requires nuanced reasoning.

**Prompt:**
> "Should a self-driving car be programmed to prioritize the lives of its passengers over the lives of pedestrians in an unavoidable accident scenario? Explain your reasoning."

---

### Part 2: The AI Response
1.  Open your preferred AI assistant (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
2.  Copy and paste the prompt exactly as written above into the AI.
3.  Save the complete, unedited response generated by the AI.

---

### Part 3: The Human Response
1.  **Before** you deeply analyze the AI's answer, take 10-15 minutes to write your own response to the prompt.
2.  Don't worry about perfection. The goal is to capture your own genuine reasoning process, values, and conclusion.

### Part 4: The Comparative Analysis
Now, review both the AI's response and your own. Use the following questions to guide your analysis.

**On Depth:**
*   Which response was more structured? Which had more emotional or ethical depth?
*   Did the AI provide a balanced overview of different ethical frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology)?
*   Did your human response draw on personal experiences, values, or intuitions that the AI could not?

**On Bias:**
*   Can you identify any implicit biases in the AI's response? For example, does it favor a particular philosophical viewpoint, or does it use safe, non-committal language to avoid taking a stance?
*   What biases are evident in your own response? Are they rooted in your culture, upbringing, or personal values? Are you more aware of them now?

**On Context:**
*   Did the AI seem to understand the full weight of the life-and-death scenario, or did it treat it as a purely abstract problem?
*   Did your response consider factors the AI missed, such as the age of the individuals involved, the rule of law, or the emotional impact on a human driver?

### Part 5: Group Discussion
As a group, discuss the following:
1.  What were the biggest strengths of the AI's answer? (e.g., clarity, speed, summarizing different perspectives).
2.  What were the biggest strengths of the human answers? (e.g., empathy, moral conviction, personal responsibility).
3.  How could you use the AI's response as a "thinking partner" to improve your own reasoning on this topic?
4.  After this exercise, what do you believe is the ideal role for AI in sensitive, ethical decision-making?

### Conclusion
This exercise highlights the core theme of this course: AI is a powerful tool for generating structured information and exploring possibilities. However, human reasoning remains indispensable for providing the ethical judgment, contextual understanding, and moral courage required to navigate complex, real-world problems.
