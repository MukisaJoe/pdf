# Capstone Project: Design a Human–AI Decision Framework

### Goal
To synthesize all the core concepts from this course—critical thinking, ethical reasoning, problem framing, and system design—into a single, practical document. In this capstone project, you will not write any code. Instead, you will design a complete **framework** for applying AI to a complex, real-world decision, with a focus on architecting a responsible and effective partnership between human judgment and machine intelligence.

---

### Project Overview
You will choose a high-stakes decision-making scenario from a list of domains and design a detailed Human-AI Decision Framework for it. Your framework will serve as a blueprint that outlines the specific role of the AI, the indispensable role of the human expert, and the ethical safeguards that govern their interaction.

---

### Step 1: Choose Your Domain and Define the Problem

First, select **one** of the following high-stakes domains:

*   **Healthcare:** A framework for using AI to help doctors prioritize patients for a limited supply of organ transplants.
*   **Hiring & HR:** A framework for using AI to help a hiring committee screen and assess candidates for a senior leadership position.
*   **University Admissions:** A framework for using AI to help an admissions committee review thousands of student applications to identify promising candidates.
*   **Civic Governance:** A framework for using AI to help a city council allocate its annual budget across various public services (e.g., parks, sanitation, public safety).

Next, deconstruct your chosen problem into a specific **prediction task** for an AI, as we practiced in Module 4.

*   *Example for University Admissions:*
    *   **Broad Problem:** "Fairly and effectively review thousands of applicants."
    *   **AI Prediction Task:** "Based on historical student data (grades, test scores, extracurriculars, etc.), **predict** a student's likelihood of graduating within four years with a GPA above 3.0."

### Step 2: Design Your Framework Document

Your primary deliverable is a document outlining your framework. It must include the following five sections.

**Section 1: Problem Framing & The AI's Role**
*   **Prediction Task:** What is the specific, narrow prediction task the AI will perform?
*   **Data:** What data will the AI use to make this prediction? Be specific.
*   **Output:** What is the precise output of the AI model? (e.g., a numerical risk score from 1-100, a classification like "High/Medium/Low Priority," a list of top 20 candidates).

**Section 2: The Human's Role & The Decision Process**
*   **The Human in the Loop:** Who is the human expert responsible for the final decision (e.g., the lead surgeon, the hiring manager, the head of admissions)?
*   **Integrating the Output:** How will the human use the AI's output? Emphasize that it is only **one input** among many.
*   **Beyond the AI:** What other information—information the AI cannot access—will the human combine with the AI's prediction? (e.g., in-person interviews, personal essays, letters of recommendation, their own expert intuition and experience).
*   **The Final Decision:** Describe the step-by-step process the human will follow to make the final, considered judgment.

**Section 3: Ethical Safeguards & Bias Mitigation**
*   **Bias Analysis:** What are the most significant potential sources of bias in your training data? (e.g., historical gender or racial bias in admissions or hiring data).
*   **Mitigation Strategy:** How will your framework attempt to mitigate this bias? (This can include technical solutions like data balancing, but should also include process-based solutions, like requiring the human to review a diverse slate of candidates).
*   **Guiding Values:** What are the core ethical values your framework is designed to uphold (e.g., fairness, equity, transparency, student well-being, public safety)?
*   **Transparency & Appeals:** How can a person affected by this decision understand the reasoning behind it? Is there a clear process for appealing the decision?

**Section 4: System-Level Integration (Optional, but encouraged)**
*   Briefly describe how your framework could be enhanced by integrating IoT (for better data collection) or Blockchain (for greater trust and transparency in the decision-making process).

**Section 5: Long-Term Vision**
*   What is the intended positive impact of your framework?
*   What is the most significant potential **unintended negative consequence** you must actively watch for as the system is used over time?
*   Write a final mission statement for your framework, explaining how it ensures that AI is used to **augment and empower** human wisdom, not replace it.

---

### Final Deliverable and Presentation
*   **Deliverable:** A 5-10 page document detailing your complete Human-AI Decision Framework.
*   **Presentation:** You will give a short presentation to the class, summarizing your chosen problem, your "Human vs. Machine" role map, and most importantly, your ethical safeguards.

### Evaluation Criteria
You will be evaluated on:
1.  The clarity and precision of your problem framing.
2.  The thoughtfulness you put into defining the distinct roles of the human and the AI.
3.  The rigor and practicality of your ethical safeguards and bias mitigation strategies.
4.  The clarity of your vision for how to create a responsible, human-centered intelligent system.
