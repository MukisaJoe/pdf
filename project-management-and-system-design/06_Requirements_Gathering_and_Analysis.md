# Chapter 6: Requirements Gathering and Analysis

Requirements gathering and analysis is the foundation of the system design process. It's about understanding what the system needs to do, who will use it, and under what constraints it must operate. Inaccurate or incomplete requirements are a leading cause of project failure.

## 1. What are Requirements?

A requirement is a statement of what a system must do or a quality it must have. Requirements can be categorized in several ways:

- **Functional Requirements:** These define the specific behaviors or functions of the system (e.g., "The system shall allow users to reset their password.").
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** These define the quality attributes of the system, such as performance, security, and reliability (e.g., "The system shall respond to user queries within 2 seconds.").
- **Business Requirements:** These are high-level goals of the organization, and they provide the context for the system (e.g., "The system shall reduce customer service response times by 20%.").

## 2. Techniques for Gathering Requirements

There are many techniques for gathering requirements, and the best approach often involves a combination of methods.

- **Interviews:** One-on-one conversations with stakeholders to understand their needs.
- **Surveys and Questionnaires:** A way to gather information from a large number of people.
- **Workshops:** A collaborative session with a group of stakeholders to define requirements.
- **Observation:** Watching users interact with the existing system or perform their daily tasks.
- **Prototyping:** Creating a preliminary version of the system to get feedback from users.
- **Document Analysis:** Reviewing existing documentation, such as business plans, process flows, and user manuals.

## 3. The Requirements Analysis Process

Once requirements have been gathered, they need to be analyzed to ensure they are:

- **Clear:** Unambiguous and easy to understand.
- **Complete:** All necessary information is present.
- **Consistent:** They do not contradict each other.
- **Testable:** It's possible to verify that the requirement has been met.
- **Feasible:** They can be implemented within the project's constraints.

## 4. Documenting Requirements

Requirements are typically documented in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. The SRS serves as a contract between the project team and the stakeholders, and it provides a baseline for the design and testing phases.

### Common elements of an SRS:
- **Introduction:** Purpose, scope, and overview of the system.
- **Overall Description:** Product perspective, product functions, user characteristics, constraints, and assumptions.
- **Specific Requirements:** Functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and interface requirements.

## 5. The Role of AI in Requirements Gathering

AI is starting to play a role in requirements gathering and analysis. AI-powered tools can:
- **Analyze user feedback to identify common themes and requests.**
- **Automatically generate user stories from unstructured text.**
- **Identify potential conflicts or ambiguities in requirements.**

As a project manager, understanding how to leverage these tools can help you to create more accurate and complete requirements, which is a critical first step in building a successful system.
