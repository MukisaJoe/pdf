# Chapter 8: High-Level System Architecture Design

High-level system architecture design is the process of defining the overall structure of a system. It's about making the big decisions that will shape the system and ensure that it meets the non-functional requirements, such as performance, scalability, and security.

## 1. What is System Architecture?

System architecture is the conceptual model that defines the structure, behavior, and more views of a system. It can be thought of as a blueprint for the system, and it provides a plan for how the system will be built.

### Key elements of system architecture:
- **Components:** The major parts of the system.
- **Connectors:** The pathways of communication between components.
- **Constraints:** The rules and guidelines that govern the design.

## 2. Architectural Patterns

Architectural patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software architecture. They provide a template for how to structure a system.

### Common architectural patterns:
- **Client-Server:** A distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.
- **Monolithic:** An application that is built as a single, self-contained unit.
- **Microservices:** An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.
- **Event-Driven:** An architecture where the flow of the program is determined by events, such as user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other programs.
- **Layered:** An architecture where the components are organized into horizontal layers, each with a specific responsibility.

## 3. Key Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns:** Dividing the system into distinct sections, with each section addressing a separate concern.
- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each component should have only one reason to change.
- **Principle of Least Knowledge (Law of Demeter):** A component should have only limited knowledge about other components.
- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic.
- **Scalability:** The ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work.
- **Security:** Protecting the system from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

## 4. The Role of the Project Manager in Architecture Design

As a project manager, you are not expected to be the system architect, but you play a crucial role in the process. You must:
- **Ensure that the architecture aligns with the business goals and project constraints.**
- **Facilitate communication between the architects, developers, and other stakeholders.**
- **Understand the trade-offs between different architectural choices.**
- **Manage the risks associated with the architecture.**

In the age of AI, systems are becoming increasingly complex. A solid understanding of system architecture is essential for any project manager who wants to lead technical projects successfully. This chapter has introduced the key concepts and principles of high-level system architecture design.
