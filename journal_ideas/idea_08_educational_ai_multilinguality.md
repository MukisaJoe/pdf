# Building a Modular, Multilingual AI Tutoring System for Under-Resourced Languages: A Case Study in Luganda-English Education

## Abstract
The benefits of AI-powered education are not yet accessible to speakers of many of the world's languages. This paper presents a case study in the development of a modular, multilingual AI tutoring system for an under-resourced language pair: Luganda and English. We detail the challenges of building such a system, from the lack of training data to the need for culturally-relevant pedagogical strategies. We then present our solutions, including a novel approach to data augmentation, a modular architecture that allows for the easy integration of new language pairs, and a user-friendly interface designed in collaboration with a community of Luganda-speaking students and educators. Our findings provide a roadmap for other researchers and practitioners who are working to make AI education more equitable and accessible.

## Introduction
The digital language divide is a major barrier to global educational equity. While speakers of high-resource languages like English have access to a growing number of AI-powered learning tools, speakers of under-resourced languages are being left behind. This paper addresses this challenge by documenting our experience in building a modular, multilingual AI tutoring system for Luganda and English. Luganda, a Bantu language spoken primarily in Uganda, is a prime example of an under-resourced language with a vibrant community of speakers who could benefit from AI-powered educational tools.

## Related Works
The field of natural language processing (NLP) for under-resourced languages has made significant strides in recent years. Techniques like transfer learning and cross-lingual embeddings have made it possible to build NLP models for languages with limited training data. However, the application of these techniques to the development of AI tutoring systems is still a new and challenging area of research. Our work is one of the first to provide a comprehensive case study of the development of an AI tutoring system for an under-resourced African language. By openly sharing our methodology, our code, and our findings, we hope to accelerate progress in this important and under-served area of research.
