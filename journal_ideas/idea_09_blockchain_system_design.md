# A Comparative Analysis of Blockchain Platforms for Decentralized AI: A Performance and Resilience Benchmark

## Abstract
The choice of a blockchain platform is a critical design decision for any decentralized AI application. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of four leading blockchain platforms for this purpose: Hyperledger Fabric, Quorum, IOTA, and Ethereum. We evaluate the performance and resilience of each platform on a standardized federated learning workload. Our benchmark includes metrics such as transaction throughput, latency, cost, and resilience to common adversarial attacks. Our findings provide a detailed and nuanced picture of the strengths and weaknesses of each platform, offering valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners who are designing the next generation of decentralized AI systems.

## Introduction
The convergence of blockchain and AI has the potential to create a new generation of intelligent, decentralized, and trustworthy systems. However, the rapid proliferation of blockchain platforms has made it difficult for researchers and practitioners to choose the right tool for the job. Each platform has its own unique architecture, consensus mechanism, and performance characteristics. This paper aims to bring clarity to this complex landscape by providing a rigorous and objective benchmark of four of the most promising platforms for decentralized AI.

## Related Works
While there have been several studies that have benchmarked the performance of individual blockchain platforms, there is a lack of research that has specifically focused on their suitability for decentralized AI applications. Our work is the first to provide a head-to-head comparison of Hyperledger Fabric, Quorum, IOTA, and Ethereum on a standardized federated learning workload. By using a consistent methodology and a comprehensive set of metrics, we are able to provide a more accurate and insightful comparison than has been previously available.
