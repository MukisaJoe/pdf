# A Game-Theoretic Approach to Validator Selection in Blockchain-Based Federated Learning

## Abstract
This paper models the validator selection process in blockchain-based federated learning as a non-cooperative game. We analyze the strategic interactions between participants, who can choose to be honest or malicious, and the network, which must select a set of validators to produce the next block. We show that in a standard FL setting, there can be a Nash equilibrium where it is rational for participants to be malicious. We then propose a novel, game-theoretic validator selection algorithm that incentivizes honest behavior by rewarding trustworthy participants and punishing malicious ones. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results show that our algorithm can significantly increase the percentage of honest participants in the network and improve the accuracy and robustness of the global model.

## Introduction
The security of federated learning is a classic collective action problem. While all participants would benefit from a secure and accurate global model, each individual participant has an incentive to act maliciously to either sabotage the model or gain an unfair advantage. This paper uses the tools of game theory to formally analyze this problem and to design a validator selection mechanism that can overcome it.

Game theory has been used to analyze a wide range of problems in computer science, from network routing to resource allocation. In the context of blockchain, game theory has been used to analyze the security of consensus mechanisms and the economics of cryptocurrency mining. Our work is the first to apply game theory to the problem of validator selection in blockchain-based federated learning. By formally modeling the strategic interactions between participants, we are able to gain a deeper understanding of the security challenges and to design a more effective and robust solution.
