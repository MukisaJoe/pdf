# SmartQuant: A Hybrid, Entropy-Aware Quantization Framework for High-Performance, Low-Memory LLMs

## Abstract
The increasing size of Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant challenge to their deployment on resource-constrained devices. This paper introduces SmartQuant, a novel hybrid quantization framework that combines the strengths of several techniques to achieve significant model compression without sacrificing performance. SmartQuant utilizes an entropy-aware Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for layer pruning, a Directional Residual Quantization (DRQ) for weight compression, and the BitsAndBytes library for efficient 4-bit quantization. We evaluate SmartQuant on a range of popular LLMs, including TinyLLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma. Our results show that SmartQuant can reduce model size by up to 80% while maintaining perplexity and downstream task performance on par with the original models.

## Introduction
The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their widespread adoption in a variety of applications. However, their massive size, often running into billions of parameters, makes them inaccessible for many use cases that require deployment on devices with limited memory and computational power. Quantization, the process of reducing the precision of a model's weights, has emerged as a promising technique for addressing this challenge. However, existing quantization methods often face a trade-off between compression ratio and performance. Aggressive quantization can lead to a significant drop in model accuracy. In this paper, we propose SmartQuant, a hybrid framework that intelligently combines multiple quantization techniques to navigate this trade-off more effectively.

## Related Works
The field of model compression has seen a flurry of research in recent years. Techniques like pruning, knowledge distillation, and quantization have all been explored. Within quantization, popular methods include post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT). While effective, these methods often treat all layers of the model uniformly. Our work is inspired by the observation that different layers of an LLM have different sensitivities to quantization. SmartQuant is the first framework to use an entropy-aware PCA to identify and prune less important layers before applying a combination of DRQ and 4-bit quantization. This hybrid, layer-aware approach allows for a much more aggressive compression of the model without the catastrophic performance degradation seen in other methods.
