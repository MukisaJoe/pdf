# Digital Evangelism: A New Model for Faith-Based Communication in the 21st Century

## Abstract
This paper explores the use of technology and art for digital evangelism. The author, a computer engineering PhD student and a spiritual writer, shares his experience in using a combination of engraving-style t-shirts, a personal blog, and social media to communicate a message of faith and healing. The paper argues that digital evangelism requires a new model of communication, one that is more personal, authentic, and relational than traditional forms of evangelism. The paper provides a set of practical recommendations for other faith-based communicators who are interested in using technology to share their message with the world.

## Introduction
The internet has transformed the way we communicate, and the church is still struggling to catch up. Traditional models of evangelism, which often rely on one-way communication from a pulpit or a printing press, are no longer as effective as they once were. This paper proposes a new model of digital evangelism, one that is more suited for the interactive and relational nature of the internet.

## Related Works
The intersection of faith and technology is a growing area of interest for both scholars and practitioners. Much of this work, however, has focused on the use of technology for church administration or online worship services. There is a comparative lack of research that has explored the use of technology for evangelism. Our work is one of the first to propose a new model of digital evangelism that is grounded in both theological reflection and practical experience.
