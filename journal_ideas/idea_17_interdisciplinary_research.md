# The Interdisciplinary Mind: A Case Study of a Research Portfolio Spanning AI, Blockchain, and Educational Technology

## Abstract
This paper presents a case study of an interdisciplinary research portfolio that spans the fields of AI, blockchain, and educational technology. The author, a computer engineering PhD student, reflects on the challenges and opportunities of working at the intersection of multiple disciplines. The paper argues that interdisciplinary research is essential for solving the complex challenges of the 21st century, but that it also requires a unique set of skills and a different approach to research. The paper provides a set of practical recommendations for other researchers who are interested in pursuing interdisciplinary research.

## Introduction
The traditional academic disciplines are no longer sufficient to address the complex and interconnected challenges of the 21st century. From climate change to global pandemics to the spread of fake news, the problems we face require a more holistic and interdisciplinary approach. This paper provides a personal account of the challenges and rewards of pursuing interdisciplinary research as a PhD student.

## Related Works
The call for more interdisciplinary research is not new. However, there is a lack of research that has provided a detailed and personal account of what it is like to do interdisciplinary research as a PhD student. Our work is one of the first to provide such an account. By sharing our experiences, we hope to inspire and encourage other young researchers to pursue their own interdisciplinary passions.
