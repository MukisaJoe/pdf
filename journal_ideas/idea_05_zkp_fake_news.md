# NeuroZKP-ARX: An AI-Enhanced, Privacy-Preserving Architecture for Fake News Mitigation on a Decentralized Web

## Abstract
The proliferation of fake news on social media platforms poses a significant threat to democratic societies. This paper introduces NeuroZKP-ARX, a novel, AI-enhanced, and privacy-preserving architecture for detecting and mitigating the spread of fake news. Our system integrates a custom blockchain with Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) powered verification, IPFS for decentralized storage, and a real-time AI for claim validation. The NeuroZKP-ARX system allows users to flag potential fake news, have it verified by an AI model, and then have the verification result recorded on an immutable ledger, all without revealing the identity of the flagger or the verifier. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through a prototype implementation and a series of experiments. Our results show that NeuroZKP-ARX can accurately detect fake news with low latency while preserving user privacy.

## Introduction
The digital age has democratized the creation and dissemination of information, but it has also created a fertile ground for the spread of fake news. Malicious actors can easily manipulate public opinion by spreading false or misleading information on a massive scale. Existing solutions, which often rely on centralized fact-checking organizations, are struggling to keep up with the sheer volume of new content. This paper proposes a new approach, one that combines the power of artificial intelligence with the security and privacy of blockchain and Zero-Knowledge Proofs. We envision a decentralized ecosystem where any user can flag potential fake news, and an AI model can provide a real-time, unbiased assessment of its veracity, all while protecting the privacy of everyone involved.

## Related Works
The fight against fake news has attracted significant attention from the research community. AI-based approaches have focused on developing models that can automatically detect fake news based on its content, style, or propagation patterns. Blockchain-based approaches have focused on creating decentralized platforms for news verification, where users can stake tokens to vouch for the credibility of a story. Our work is the first to combine these two approaches in a synergistic way. By using ZKPs, we can leverage the power of AI for claim validation without creating a new centralized point of failure or compromising user privacy. The NeuroZKP-ARX system represents a significant step forward in the development of a more trustworthy and resilient information ecosystem.
