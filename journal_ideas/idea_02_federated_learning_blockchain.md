# Enhancing the Security of Federated Learning through Blockchain-based Validator Selection and Robust Aggregation

## Abstract
Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative machine learning without centralizing data, but it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks from malicious participants. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages blockchain technology to secure FL systems. We introduce two key innovations: 1) a novel, entropy-aware validator selection algorithm that identifies and rewards trustworthy participants, and 2) a custom aggregation method that combines the strengths of FedAvg, Median, and Krum under a blockchain-based consensus mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive simulations in a hostile environment with a high percentage of adversarial participants. Our results show that our approach significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of the global model compared to standard FL and other blockchain-based FL solutions.

## Introduction
Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving paradigm for training machine learning models on decentralized data. However, the very decentralization that provides privacy also creates security vulnerabilities. Malicious participants can launch a variety of attacks, such as data poisoning and model poisoning, to degrade the performance of the global model or insert backdoors. While several robust aggregation methods have been proposed to mitigate these attacks, they often struggle in the face of sophisticated adversaries. This paper argues that a more holistic approach is needed, one that not only protects the aggregation process but also ensures the trustworthiness of the participants themselves. We propose a novel solution that uses blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent ecosystem for federated learning.

## Related Works
The intersection of blockchain and federated learning is a burgeoning field of research. Some studies have proposed using blockchain to store and track model updates, while others have focused on using smart contracts to manage the FL process. However, most existing work relies on simple validator selection mechanisms (e.g., random selection) and standard aggregation methods. Our work introduces a more sophisticated approach, inspired by the principles of TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving), to address the fundamental contradiction between decentralization and security. Our entropy-aware validator selection algorithm is the first of its kind, and our custom aggregation method is specifically designed to work in synergy with the underlying blockchain consensus, providing a level of security that is not achievable with existing solutions.
