# The Man I Met on the Way to the Sea: An Exploration of Human-AI Collaboration in Spiritual Writing

## Abstract
This paper presents a case study in the use of AI as a collaborative partner in the process of spiritual writing. The author, a computer engineering PhD student, documents his experience in writing a book of spiritual poetry, "The Man I Met on the Way to the Sea," with the help of a large language model. The paper explores the philosophical and theological implications of human-AI collaboration in a creative and spiritual context. It also provides a practical guide for other writers who are interested in using AI as a tool for their own creative and spiritual exploration.

## Introduction
The rise of large language models has opened up new possibilities for human-AI collaboration in a wide range of creative fields. This paper explores one such possibility: the use of AI as a collaborative partner in the process of spiritual writing. The author shares his personal journey of writing a book of spiritual poetry with the help of an AI, reflecting on the ways in which the AI both helped and hindered his creative process. The paper argues that AI can be a powerful tool for spiritual exploration, but only if it is used with intention, discernment, and a deep understanding of its limitations.

## Related Works
The intersection of AI and creativity is a rapidly growing field of research. Much of this research has focused on the use of AI to generate art, music, and literature. There is a comparative lack of research that has explored the use of AI as a collaborative partner in the creative process. Our work is one of the first to provide a detailed and personal account of human-AI collaboration in a spiritual writing context.
