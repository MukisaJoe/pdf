# A User-Centered Design Process for a Multi-Agent AI Tutoring System

## Abstract
The success of an AI tutoring system depends not only on the quality of its AI models but also on the quality of its user experience (UX). This paper presents a detailed case study of the user-centered design process for a multi-agent AI tutoring system. We document our entire process, from initial user research and persona development to a multi-stage usability testing process. We discuss the key design decisions we made and the impact they had on the final system. Our findings provide a set of best practices for designing and evaluating the UX of AI tutoring systems.

## Introduction
The field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has a long history of developing methods for designing and evaluating user interfaces. However, the application of these methods to the design of AI-powered systems is still a new and challenging area of research. This is particularly true for AI tutoring systems, where the user experience is critical to the system's educational effectiveness. This paper provides a practical guide for researchers and practitioners who are working to design AI tutoring systems that are not only intelligent but also usable, engaging, and effective.

## Related Works
The field of AI in education has traditionally focused on the a
development of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). While these systems have become increasingly sophisticated, they have often been criticized for their poor user interfaces. More recent research has started to focus on the user experience of AI tutoring systems, but there is still a lack of research that provides a detailed and comprehensive account of the user-centered design process. Our work is one of the first to provide a complete case study of the user-centered design of a multi-agent AI tutoring system.
