# A Lightweight, Fault-Resilient Blockchain Architecture for Real-Time Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) Environments

## Abstract
The integration of blockchain technology into the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is hampered by the high computational and energy costs of traditional consensus mechanisms. This paper introduces a novel, lightweight blockchain architecture designed specifically for constrained IIoT environments. Our architecture utilizes a custom Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism with validator rotation, offline transaction handling, and smart auto-mining to ensure low-power, fault-resilient operation. We demonstrate the system's effectiveness through a real-world implementation using Raspberry Pi nodes and various industrial sensors (DHT22, flame sensors). The proposed system functions as a fully independent, real-time edge chain while maintaining Layer-2 interoperability with Ethereum and IPFS. Our results show a significant improvement in transaction throughput and energy efficiency compared to existing solutions, paving the way for wider adoption of blockchain in industrial settings.

## Introduction
The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) promises to revolutionize manufacturing, supply chain management, and industrial automation. However, the vast amounts of data generated by IIoT devices raise significant concerns about data integrity, security, and trust. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable ledger, is a natural candidate for addressing these challenges. Unfortunately, existing blockchain solutions like Bitcoin and Ethereum are ill-suited for the resource-constrained nature of IIoT devices. Their Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms are computationally expensive and introduce significant latency, making them impractical for real-time industrial applications. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a lightweight blockchain architecture tailored for the unique demands of the IIoT.

## Related Works
The application of blockchain to IoT has been explored by several researchers. Early work focused on adapting existing blockchains like Ethereum for IoT applications, but these approaches often struggled with scalability and cost. More recent research has explored lightweight consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Authority (PoA) and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) (e.g., IOTA). While these represent steps in the right direction, they often lack the specific features required for industrial applications, such as robust fault tolerance, offline transaction handling, and seamless interoperability with both legacy industrial systems and public blockchains. Our work is the first to combine a custom PoA mechanism with validator rotation, smart auto-mining, and a dedicated offline transaction handling protocol, all within a fully independent edge chain architecture.
