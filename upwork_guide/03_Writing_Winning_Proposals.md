# 03: Writing Winning Proposals on Upwork

A strong profile gets you found, but a compelling proposal gets you hired. Your goal is to move beyond generic, copy-pasted proposals and write a targeted message that proves you are the single best expert for the job. This guide provides a structure and template for doing just that.

## The Anatomy of a High-Impact Proposal

Most freelancers on Upwork use a generic, self-centered template. You will do the opposite. Your proposal will be client-centered, demonstrating that you understand their problem and have the unique skills to solve it.

**Key Principles:**
1.  **Read the Job Post Carefully:** Address the client's specific points. Use their name if they provide it.
2.  **Hook Them Immediately:** The first two lines are visible in the client's preview. Make them count.
3.  **Prove You're an Expert, Don't Just Claim It:** Instead of saying "I'm a blockchain expert," say "Your need for a secure, offline-resilient ledger is very similar to a custom PoA blockchain I built for an IIoT network."
4.  **Ask Insightful Questions:** This shows you're already thinking about the project and engages the client in a conversation.
5.  **Keep it Concise:** Respect the client's time. Use clear formatting (like bullet points) to make it easy to read.

## The Winning Proposal Template

Here is a reusable template designed to incorporate your specific expertise.

**Subject: Re: [Project Title from Job Post]**

Hi [Client Name, if available, otherwise use "there"],

I've carefully reviewed your project description and am confident I can deliver a robust solution. Your need for [mention a specific, key requirement from the job post] is directly aligned with my expertise in [mention your relevant core skill, e.g., AI model compression, custom blockchain development].

Based on your requirements, I have a few initial thoughts/questions:
*   [Ask an insightful question about their technical challenge. E.g., "Have you considered the trade-offs between latency and final model accuracy for the quantization process? My work on DEAQ could be relevant here."]
*   [Ask a question about the business goal. E.g., "Is the primary goal of this IIoT system to provide real-time alerts, or is it for long-term data logging and analysis?"]

This approach is similar to a project where I [connect to one of your key projects]. For instance, I designed and built a **custom Proof-of-Authority blockchain** that handled sensor-triggered transactions for an industrial client. That system prioritized [mention a relevant benefit, e.g., offline resilience and data integrity], which seems to be a key concern for you as well.

You can find a brief case study on that project in my portfolio here: [Link to your relevant portfolio item].

I am available to discuss your project in more detail this week.

Best regards,

## How to Customize the Template: An Example

Let's say the client posts a job titled: **"Need Expert to Quantize a Mistral-7B Model for Edge Device."**

Your proposal could look like this:

**Subject: Re: Need Expert to Quantize a Mistral-7B Model for Edge Device**

Hi [Client Name],

I've carefully reviewed your project description and am confident I can help you successfully quantize your Mistral-7B model for deployment on an edge device. Your goal of minimizing performance degradation is directly aligned with my research and implementation work in AI model compression.

Based on your requirements, I have a few initial questions:
*   What are the specific hardware constraints of the target edge device (e.g., RAM, processor type)?
*   Have you benchmarked a baseline performance for the un-quantized model that we need to stay as close to as possible?

This challenge is very similar to my recent work where I developed custom quantization techniques like **Directional Entropy-Aware Quantization (DEAQ)** and **SinQuant**. These methods were designed specifically to preserve the performance of large language models like Mistral-7B during compression. For one project, I was able to achieve a 4x size reduction with less than a 2% drop in benchmark accuracy.

I have a deep understanding of the trade-offs involved and can help you choose and implement the right strategy.

I am available to discuss your project in more detail this week.

Best regards,

Jonathan Mukisa
