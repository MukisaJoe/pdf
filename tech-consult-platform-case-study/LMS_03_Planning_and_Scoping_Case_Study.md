# LMS Case Study: Chapter 3 - Project Planning and Scoping

## 3.1 Project Scope Statement

**Project:** Emerging Tech LMS (Version 1.0 Launch)

**Project Justification:** To develop a premier online learning platform that provides professionals with accessible, high-quality courses on critical emerging technologies, filling a gap in the current e-learning market.

**Project Deliverables:**
1.  A fully functional, production-ready LMS web application.
2.  An initial library of 10-15 high-quality video courses.
3.  A content management system (CMS) for internal staff to upload and manage courses.
4.  Comprehensive technical and user documentation.
5.  A trained support team ready for platform launch.

**In-Scope Features for V1.0:**
-   User authentication (signup/login) for "Student" and "Admin" roles.
-   User profiles with course history and certificates.
-   A course catalog with search and filtering capabilities.
-   Course enrollment and progress tracking.
-   A secure video player for delivering course content.
-   A simple quiz engine for knowledge assessment.
-   Automated generation of PDF certificates upon course completion.

**Out-of-Scope Features for V1.0:**
-   Instructor-facing dashboards and course creation tools.
-   Social learning features (e.g., discussion forums, study groups).
-   Corporate and team accounts.
-   Advanced analytics on student performance.
-   Native mobile applications (iOS/Android).

**Project Constraints:**
-   **Budget:** The project must be completed within the allocated budget of $250,000.
-   **Timeline:** The V1.0 platform must be launched within 9 months.
-   **Technology:** The platform will be built using a modern web stack, with PostgreSQL as the specified database.
-   **Content:** The initial 10-15 courses will be developed in parallel by a separate content team and must be ready for integration on schedule.

**Project Assumptions:**
-   The chosen technology stack can support the required video streaming and user load.
-   The content team will deliver finalized course materials (videos, quiz questions) according to the project schedule.
-   A group of at least 50 beta testers can be recruited for UAT.
