# App Builder Case Study: Chapter 4 - Project Execution and Monitoring

## 4.1 Executing the Project Plan

The execution of "Project Fusion" will be managed through a series of 2-week sprints, as defined by our Scrum methodology. The central activity of each sprint will be to build a demonstrable increment of the app builder platform.

The execution process is designed to be highly transparent and user-focused:
-   **Sprint Goal:** Each sprint will have a clear goal, such as "Users can now describe a data model in text and see a proposed schema" or "The system can now generate a basic backend API from an approved schema."
-   **Sprint Review:** This is the most critical ceremony. At the end of each sprint, the development team will demo the latest features to the pilot user group. This is not a presentation; it is a hands-on session where pilot users are encouraged to try the new functionality and provide direct, honest feedback.
-   **Feedback Loop:** Feedback from the Sprint Review will be captured by the Product Owner and translated into new user stories or adjustments to existing ones in the product backlog for the next sprint.

## 4.2 Monitoring and Controlling the Project

We will use a combination of agile metrics and qualitative feedback to monitor and control the project.
-   **Progress Tracking:** We will use **Jira** to manage our product backlog. A **sprint burndown chart** will be used to track work completed against the plan within each sprint. A higher-level **release burndown chart** will track overall progress toward the 9-month MVP launch.
-   **Pilot Program Feedback Log:** A dedicated log (e.g., in Confluence or a SharePoint list) will be maintained to capture all qualitative feedback, suggestions, and pain points reported by the pilot user group. The Product Owner will review this log daily.
-   **Change Management:** Given the iterative nature, some change is expected. However, any change that significantly alters the core MVP scope (as defined in Chapter 3) will require a formal review and approval from the project's steering committee.

## 4.3 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Our KPIs are designed to measure both project efficiency and, more importantly, the success of the final product in the hands of our users.

### Project Management KPIs

-   **Sprint Velocity:** To measure the team's productivity and improve the predictability of future sprints.
-   **Budget vs. Actuals:** Monthly tracking of project spend against the $450,000 budget.
-   **Team Morale:** Anonymous quarterly surveys to ensure the project team remains healthy and motivated.

### Product Success KPIs (Measured during the Pilot Program)

These are the ultimate measures of whether Project Fusion is achieving its goal of empowerment.
-   **Time to First App (TTFA):** The average time it takes for a new user, after training, to successfully build and deploy their first simple application. **Target: < 1 hour.**
-   **Adoption & Engagement:** The total number of applications created by the pilot group, and the number of active users within those generated apps.
-   **System Usability Scale (SUS):** We will administer the SUS, a standardized 10-item questionnaire, to our pilot users monthly. It gives a quantitative score of the tool's perceived ease of use. **Target: A SUS score of > 80 (which corresponds to "Excellent").**
-   **Reduction in IT Tickets:** A long-term KPI, measured after the full rollout, to track the reduction in requests for simple applications submitted to the central IT department. **Target: 25% reduction in small app requests within 6 months of full launch.**

By focusing on these user-centric success metrics, we ensure that we are building a tool that not only works technically but also provides real, measurable value to the organization.
