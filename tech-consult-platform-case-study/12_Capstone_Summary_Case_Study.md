# Case Study: Chapter 12 - Project Charter & Capstone Summary

## Project Title: The Tech Consult Platform (MVP)

---

### 1. Project Vision & Business Case
**Vision:** To become the most trusted and efficient online marketplace for connecting businesses with elite technology consultants.

**Business Case:** The current market for freelance tech talent is fragmented and often inefficient. Clients struggle to find vetted, high-quality consultants, while top consultants spend too much time on business development rather than billable work. This platform will address this gap by providing a curated, high-trust environment that streamlines the process of finding, hiring, and collaborating with technical experts.
