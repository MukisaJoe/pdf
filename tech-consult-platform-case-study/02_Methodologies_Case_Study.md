# Case Study: Chapter 2 - Project Management Methodology

## 2.1 Methodology Selection

For the Tech Consult Platform project, we have selected the **Scrum** framework, which is a key implementation of the Agile methodology. The decision to use Scrum is based on the nature of the projectâ€”a new product development effort in a dynamic market.

## 2.2 Justification for Choosing Scrum

Scrum provides the flexibility and iterative progress needed for this project. Here's why it's the right fit compared to other methodologies:

### Scrum vs. Waterfall

-   **Flexibility:** The Waterfall model is a sequential, linear approach that requires all requirements to be defined upfront. For a new platform like ours, requirements are likely to evolve as we get feedback from early users. Scrum's iterative nature, with its 2-4 week sprints, allows us to adapt to change and incorporate feedback throughout the development process.
-   **Speed to Market:** Scrum enables us to deliver a working increment of the product at the end of each sprint. This means we can launch a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) faster and start getting real-world feedback, which is crucial for a startup. A Waterfall approach would mean a long development cycle with no tangible product until the very end.
-   **Risk Reduction:** By building the product in small increments, we can identify and address risks early. If a feature is more complex than anticipated or not resonating with users, we can pivot quickly. In a Waterfall project, such issues might not be discovered until the late testing phase, when they are much more costly to fix.

### Scrum vs. Kanban

-   **Structure:** While Kanban is also an Agile approach that excels at visualizing workflow and managing continuous delivery, Scrum provides more structure through its time-boxed sprints, defined roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team), and regular ceremonies (Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective). For a new project with a clear goal (launching an MVP), the structure of sprints provides a regular cadence for planning and review, which is beneficial.
-   **Predictability:** The fixed length of sprints in Scrum allows for a certain level of predictability in the short term. We can commit to a set of features for each sprint, which helps in communicating progress to stakeholders. Kanban is more flow-based and less focused on fixed time-boxed commitments.

## 2.3 Implementation of Scrum

We will implement the Scrum framework as follows:
-   **Sprint Length:** 2-week sprints.
-   **Key Roles:**
    -   **Product Owner:** Responsible for managing the product backlog and prioritizing features to maximize value.
    -   **Scrum Master:** Facilitates the Scrum process and removes impediments for the development team.
    -   **Development Team:** A cross-functional team of designers and engineers responsible for delivering a potentially shippable increment of the product at the end of each sprint.
-   **Artifacts:** We will maintain a Product Backlog, a Sprint Backlog for each sprint, and a clear Definition of Done for all work.
-   **Ceremonies:** All standard Scrum events will be held to ensure transparency and continuous improvement.

By adopting Scrum, we are prioritizing adaptability, customer collaboration, and the delivery of working software, which are all critical for the success of the Tech Consult Platform project.
