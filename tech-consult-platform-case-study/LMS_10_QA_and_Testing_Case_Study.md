# LMS Case Study: Chapter 10 - Quality Assurance and Testing

## 10.1 Quality Philosophy

For the "Emerging Tech LMS," quality is a cornerstone of the user experience. A buggy or unreliable platform will quickly lose the trust of its students. Therefore, quality is a proactive, team-wide responsibility, focused on preventing defects through robust processes and comprehensive testing.

## 10.2 Quality Assurance (Process-Oriented)

Our QA strategy is built on embedding quality into every step of the development process:
-   **Peer Code Reviews:** A mandatory review of all code by another developer to catch issues, enforce standards, and share knowledge.
-   **Continuous Integration (CI):** A CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) will automatically run all tests on every code change, providing immediate feedback to developers.
-   **Strict Definition of Done:** No work is considered complete until it meets a clear, predefined set of quality criteria (see below).

## 10.3 Quality Control (The Testing Pyramid)

Our testing activities are structured as a pyramid to maximize effectiveness and maintain high development velocity.

-   **Level 1: Unit Tests (Foundation):**
    -   **Backend (`pytest`):** We will test individual functions and classes in isolation. For example, testing the logic that calculates a student's course completion percentage.
    -   **Frontend (`Jest` & `React Testing Library`):** We will test individual React components, such as the video player controls or a quiz question component.
-   **Level 2: Integration Tests:**
    -   These tests verify the interaction between different parts of the system. For example, we will test the API endpoint for quiz submission to ensure it correctly validates answers, calculates the score, and saves the result to the database.
-   **Level 3: End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Peak):**
    -   Using a framework like `Cypress`, we will automate a few critical, high-value user journeys from start to finish.
    -   **Primary E2E Scenario:** A student successfully signs up, enrolls in the "Intro to AI" course, watches the first lesson video, and verifies that their dashboard correctly shows "5% complete".

## 10.4 Specialized Testing for the LMS

In addition to the standard pyramid, the unique nature of an LMS requires specialized testing:
-   **Cross-Browser & Cross-Device Testing:** We will rigorously test the learning interface, especially the video player, on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge on both desktop and mobile devices to ensure a consistent experience.
-   **Video Playback Testing:** Manually and automatically testing video streaming performance under various network conditions (e.g., using browser throttling tools).
-   **Usability Testing:** Formal, moderated testing sessions with our beta group of students to gather qualitative feedback on the ease of use and overall learning experience.

## 10.5 Definition of Done (DoD)

For a user story to be marked as "Done," it must satisfy all of the following:
-   Code is written and peer-reviewed.
-   All associated unit and integration tests are passing in the CI pipeline.
-   The feature is manually tested by the QA Engineer on a staging environment.
-   The feature meets all acceptance criteria defined in the user story.
-   Any necessary documentation has been updated.
-   The Product Owner has reviewed and formally accepted the feature.

This multi-layered testing strategy is designed to ensure the "Emerging Tech LMS" is a stable, reliable, and high-quality platform that our students can depend on.
