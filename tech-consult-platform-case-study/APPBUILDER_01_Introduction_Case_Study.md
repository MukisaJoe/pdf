# App Builder Case Study: Chapter 1 - Introduction to Project Fusion

## 1.1 Project Definition

**Project Fusion** is a strategic internal project to develop a **"Vibe Coding-based Internal App Builder"**. This project is a temporary endeavor to create a unique, AI-powered, low-code platform that will empower non-technical employees to build simple, data-driven internal web applications by describing their high-level needs, or "vibe". The project will be considered complete when the platform is successfully deployed for internal use and a pilot program with three business departments is concluded.

## 1.2 Project Characteristics

-   **Defined Scope (MVP):** The initial version of the platform will enable an employee (e.g., a business analyst) to:
    1.  Define a simple data model (e.g., "a project tracker with fields for name, owner, and due date").
    2.  Have the AI generate a backend API and database schema for that model.
    3.  Automatically generate a standard web interface with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for the data.
    -   **Out-of-Scope (MVP):** Complex business logic, workflows, third-party integrations, custom UI themes, and advanced user permissions.
-   **Specific Timeline:** The target for the MVP deployment is **9 months**.
-   **Set Budget:** The project has an internal budget allocation of **$450,000** for the development team and infrastructure.
-   **Unique Goal:** To dramatically accelerate the creation of simple internal tools and to reduce the backlog and reliance on the central IT department for basic applications like project trackers, inventory lists, and simple approval workflows.

## 1.3 Project Management Application

This project will be managed with a strong focus on user-centric design and agile principles. Success depends on building a tool that non-technical users find intuitive and powerful. Key activities will include:
-   **Identifying Requirements:** Holding continuous workshops with a pilot group of business analysts from HR, Finance, and Operations to understand their needs and pain points.
-   **Establishing Clear Objectives:** Defining measurable success criteria, such as "Enable a pilot user to build a functional 'Project Tracker' app in under one hour" and "Reduce the average time to create a simple internal tool from 2 months (IT project) to 2 days (self-service)".
-   **Balancing Competing Demands:** Managing the trade-offs between the power/flexibility of the tool and its ease of use for a non-technical audience.

## 1.4 The Role of the Project Manager

The Project Manager will lead the development of the Fusion platform. Their primary responsibility is to bridge the gap between the highly technical engineering team and the non-technical internal customers. This involves managing the product backlog, facilitating user feedback sessions, and ensuring the final product meets the business goal of empowerment and efficiency.

## 1.5 The Project Management Lifecycle

Project Fusion will follow a standard five-phase lifecycle, executed within an agile framework:
1.  **Initiation:** This current phase of defining the project's goals and feasibility.
2.  **Planning:** Creating a detailed development roadmap and resource plan.
3.  **Execution:** An iterative series of sprints to build the core platform features, with regular demos to the pilot user group.
4.  **Monitoring & Controlling:** Tracking development progress and, more importantly, the usability and success metrics from the pilot users.
5.  **Closing & Handover:** A formal launch of the platform to the wider company, with documentation, training materials, and a handover to an internal support team.

This structured approach will ensure we build a powerful and user-friendly tool that delivers real value to the organization.
