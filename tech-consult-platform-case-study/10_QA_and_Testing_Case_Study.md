# Case Study: Chapter 10 - Quality Assurance and Testing

## 10.1 Our Commitment to Quality

For the Tech Consult Platform, quality is a shared responsibility of the entire Scrum team. Our goal is not just to find bugs, but to prevent them from being introduced in the first place. We will achieve this through a combination of proactive Quality Assurance (QA) processes and reactive Quality Control (QC) activities.

## 10.2 Quality Assurance (Process-Oriented)

Our QA strategy focuses on implementing processes that build quality into the development lifecycle:
-   **Code Reviews:** All code must be reviewed by at least one other developer before being merged. This enforces coding standards, shares knowledge, and catches defects early.
-   **Definition of Done:** We will maintain a strict "Definition of Done" for all work items (see below).
-   **Continuous Integration (CI):** We will use a CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) that automatically runs all unit and integration tests on every commit, preventing broken code from being integrated.
-   **Static Code Analysis:** Linters and static analysis tools will be used to automatically check for code quality issues and potential bugs.

## 10.3 Quality Control (Testing Strategy)

Our testing strategy is modeled after the "Testing Pyramid" to ensure a fast, efficient, and comprehensive testing process.

-   **Level 1: Unit Tests (Majority of tests):**
    -   **Backend:** We will use `pytest` to write unit tests for our Django models, services, and utility functions, aiming for high code coverage.
    -   **Frontend:** We will use `Jest` and `React Testing Library` to test individual React components in isolation.
-   **Level 2: Integration Tests:**
    -   **Backend:** We will write integration tests for all API endpoints to ensure they behave as expected, interact correctly with the database, and have proper authentication and authorization checks.
    -   **Frontend:** We will test how different components interact with each other and how they manage state (e.g., using a test Redux store).
-   **Level 3: End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Fewest tests):**
    -   We will use a framework like `Cypress` or `Playwright` to automate a small number of critical user journeys in a real browser.
    -   Example E2E test cases: "A client can successfully post a new project," and "A consultant can successfully bid on a project."

## 10.4 Other Testing Activities

-   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Before the public launch, the platform will be released to a closed beta group of real clients and consultants. Their feedback will be crucial for validating that the system meets user needs.
-   **Performance Testing:** We will use a tool like `JMeter` or `k6` to load-test our most critical API endpoints to ensure they meet the performance requirements defined in Chapter 6.
-   **Security Testing:** We will run automated security scans as part of our CI pipeline. Before launch, we will conduct a thorough security audit, potentially including a third-party penetration test, to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

## 10.5 Definition of Done (DoD)

A user story or task is considered "Done" only when it meets all of the following criteria:
-   Code is complete and peer-reviewed.
-   All relevant unit and integration tests are written and passing.
-   All acceptance criteria for the user story are met.
-   The feature has been successfully tested by the QA Engineer.
-   The code has been merged into the main branch and deployed to the staging environment.
-   The Product Owner has reviewed and accepted the feature.

This comprehensive QA and testing strategy is designed to mitigate risks, ensure the platform is reliable and secure, and deliver a high-quality product to our users.
