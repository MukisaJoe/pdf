# LMS Case Study: Chapter 11 - Risk Management

## 11.1 Approach to Risk Management

Our approach to risk management for the "Emerging Tech LMS" project is proactive and continuous. We aim to identify and address potential threats before they impact the project's schedule, budget, or quality. The Risk Register is our central tool for tracking and managing these risks.

## 11.2 Risk Register

This register documents the initial set of identified risks for the LMS project. It will be a living document, reviewed and updated regularly by the project team.

| ID | Risk Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Response Strategy |
|----|------------------|----------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| **R01** | **Content Delay:** The parallel content creation process falls behind schedule, leaving the platform with no courses at launch. | **Schedule / Content** | Medium | High | **Mitigate:** Hold weekly sync meetings between the platform Product Owner and the Content Team Lead. Build the admin CMS early so content can be uploaded and tested as it's created, not all at the end. |
| **R02** | **Low Student Adoption:** The platform launches but fails to attract and retain students. | **Business / Market** | Medium | High | **Mitigate:** Engage a beta group of target users early and often for feedback. Develop and execute a multi-channel marketing strategy starting 3 months before launch. Offer an early-bird discount. |
| **R03** | **Video Streaming Issues:** The chosen video hosting/CDN solution is unreliable or too expensive at scale. | **Technical / Budget** | Low | High | **Mitigate:** Thoroughly vet and test the chosen video infrastructure with performance and load testing. Implement robust monitoring and alerting for the video pipeline. Have a backup provider identified. |
| **R04** | **Data Privacy Breach:** Student personal data is compromised, violating regulations like GDPR/CCPA. | **Legal / Security** | Low | High | **Avoid/Mitigate:** Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). Adhere to privacy-by-design principles. Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit. Have legal counsel review our privacy policy. |
| **R05** | **Instructor/Content Creator Churn:** Key instructors for high-profile courses leave before content is finalized. | **Content / Schedule** | Low | Medium | **Transfer/Mitigate:** Have clear contracts in place with content creators. Mitigate by building a strong relationship with instructors and ensuring they have the support they need. |
| **R06** | **Scope Creep:** Pressure to add "just one more feature" (e.g., social forums) before the V1.0 launch. | **Scope / Schedule** | High | Medium | **Avoid:** Adhere strictly to the defined MVP scope. All new feature ideas are to be added to the product backlog and prioritized by the Product Owner for post-launch releases. |
| **R07** | **Rapid Technology Obsolescence:** The "emerging technologies" we teach are superseded faster than we can create content. | **Business / Content** | Medium | Medium | **Accept/Mitigate:** Accept that this is a risk of the business model. Mitigate by designing a modular content creation process that allows for rapid updates to existing courses, not just creation of new ones. Focus on foundational concepts. |

## 11.3 Risk Monitoring

The Project Manager will own the Risk Register. It will be a key input for sprint planning and a topic of discussion at every Sprint Retrospective and monthly stakeholder meeting. High-probability/high-impact risks will be escalated to project sponsors immediately.
