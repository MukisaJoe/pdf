# App Builder Case Study: Chapter 2 - Project Management Methodology

## 2.1 Methodology Selection

For "Project Fusion," the development of the Vibe Coding-based App Builder, we will use the **Scrum** framework. The success of this project is critically dependent on building a tool that is both powerful and exceptionally intuitive for non-technical users. Scrum's iterative, user-centric nature makes it the ideal choice to manage this challenge.

## 2.2 Justification for Choosing Scrum

The primary reason for selecting Scrum is its emphasis on a tight feedback loop with end-users.

-   **Focus on User Feedback:** The most significant risk for this project is building a tool that is too complex or doesn't solve the right problems for our internal, non-technical employees. Scrum directly mitigates this risk through the **Sprint Review** ceremony. Every two weeks, the development team will demonstrate a working increment of the app builder to our pilot group of business analysts. This provides a regular, predictable opportunity to gather direct feedback, validate our design assumptions, and adjust the product backlog accordingly. This is far superior to a Waterfall approach, where users would only see the final product at the end, which is too late to make meaningful changes.

-   **Managing Technical Complexity:** The AI-driven code generation engine is technically complex and involves a degree of R&D. Scrum allows the team to de-risk this by tackling the complexity in small, manageable user stories. For example, an early sprint might focus only on generating a database schema, while a later sprint builds on that to generate the API. This incremental approach makes a daunting technical challenge achievable.

-   **Delivering Value Quickly:** By producing a working, testable piece of the platform every sprint, we can deliver value to the organization much faster. The pilot group can begin experimenting with very basic versions of the tool early on, which helps with buy-in and provides the development team with a constant sense of purpose and accomplishment.

## 2.3 Implementation of Scrum

-   **Sprint Length:** We will work in **2-week sprints** to ensure a rapid feedback cycle.
-   **Key Roles:**
    -   **Product Owner:** The vital link to the internal customers. They will spend significant time with the pilot group, understanding their needs and translating them into a prioritized product backlog.
    -   **Scrum Master:** A facilitator to ensure the development team is productive and the Scrum process is followed correctly.
    -   **Development Team:** A cross-functional team of AI/ML engineers, backend developers, frontend developers, and a UI/UX designer.
-   **User Involvement:** The **Pilot User Group** (from HR, Finance, Operations) is a critical, first-class participant in the process. Their attendance and active feedback at Sprint Reviews are mandatory for the project's success.

By adopting Scrum, we are building a process that forces us to stay aligned with our users, adapt to their feedback, and incrementally build a tool that truly empowers them.
