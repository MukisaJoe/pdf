# Case Study: Chapter 9 - Managing Technical Projects and Teams

## 9.1 Project Team Roles and Responsibilities

A dedicated and skilled team is essential for the success of the Tech Consult Platform. For the MVP phase, the core team will consist of the following roles:

-   **Project Manager (who also serves as Scrum Master):** Responsible for the overall project plan, budget, and timeline. As Scrum Master, they will facilitate the Scrum process, remove impediments, and ensure the team is productive.
-   **Product Owner:** Responsible for defining the product vision, managing the product backlog, and prioritizing features to deliver the most value to users and the business. This person is the primary liaison with stakeholders.
-   **UI/UX Designer:** Responsible for all aspects of the user experience, from user research and wireframing to creating the final high-fidelity visual designs and prototypes.
-   **Lead Backend Developer:** Responsible for the overall backend architecture, database design, and leading the backend development effort.
-   **Backend Developer:** Works with the lead to implement the Django REST API, business logic, and database interactions.
-   **Lead Frontend Developer:** Responsible for the frontend architecture, choice of component libraries, and leading the frontend development effort.
-   **Frontend Developer:** Works with the lead to implement the React-based user interface and connect it to the backend API.
-   **QA Engineer:** Responsible for developing and executing the testing strategy, including writing test cases, performing manual testing, and setting up automated tests.

## 9.2 Team Structure

The team will be structured as a single, cross-functional **Scrum Team**. The developers (frontend and backend), the UI/UX designer, and the QA engineer will form the Development Team. This structure ensures tight collaboration and shared ownership of the product increment delivered at the end of each sprint. The Project Manager (as Scrum Master) and Product Owner will work closely with the Development Team daily.

## 9.3 Communication Plan

A clear communication plan is vital to keep the team aligned and stakeholders informed.
