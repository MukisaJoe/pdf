# LMS Case Study: Chapter 2 - Project Management Methodology

## 2.1 Methodology Selection

For the "Emerging Tech LMS" project, the **Scrum** framework will be adopted as our core project management methodology. The development of a new, complex software platform like an LMS requires an adaptive, iterative approach, for which Scrum is ideally suited.

## 2.2 Justification for Choosing Scrum

The decision to use Scrum is based on a careful analysis of the project's needs compared to other common methodologies.

### Scrum vs. Waterfall

-   **Adapting to User Feedback:** A successful LMS depends entirely on user engagement. A traditional Waterfall model would require us to define every feature upfront, which is risky. We need to test our assumptions about how students interact with content, quizzes, and each other. Scrum's sprints allow us to release features incrementally, gather real user feedback from our beta group, and make adjustments quickly.
-   **Integrating Content and Platform Development:** The creation of course content may happen in parallel with the platform's development. Scrum provides the flexibility to adjust platform features based on the needs of the content creators and the media formats they use.
-   **Faster Time to Value:** By building the platform in increments, we can have a basic, usable version of the LMS for internal review and content loading much earlier than with a Waterfall approach. This de-risks the project significantly.

### Scrum vs. Kanban

-   **Structured Releases:** While Kanban is excellent for managing a continuous flow of small tasks, the LMS project has a clear, large-scale goal: the V1.0 launch. Scrum's time-boxed sprints provide a predictable rhythm and a clear structure for planning and delivering larger, cohesive feature sets (e.g., the complete "Quizzing Engine" or "Certificate Generation" module).
-   **Stakeholder Alignment:** The regular Sprint Reviews in Scrum are a perfect forum to demonstrate progress to stakeholders, including investors and key instructors. This formal ceremony ensures alignment and provides a predictable feedback loop that is more structured than Kanban's continuous flow.

## 2.3 Implementation of Scrum for the LMS Project

-   **Sprint Length:** We will use **3-week sprints**. This provides a good balance, allowing enough time to build meaningful features for the LMS while still being short enough to adapt to change.
-   **Key Roles:**
    -   **Product Owner:** Will manage the product backlog, prioritizing features that deliver the most value to students and instructors.
    -   **Scrum Master:** Will facilitate the Scrum process and remove any impediments, ensuring the development team can work efficiently.
    -   **Development Team:** A cross-functional team including backend developers, frontend developers, a UI/UX designer, and a QA engineer.
-   **Artifacts & Ceremonies:** We will diligently use the Product Backlog for long-term planning, Sprint Backlogs for each sprint, and hold all standard Scrum ceremonies to maintain transparency and promote continuous improvement.

By using Scrum, we commit to an agile mindset that prioritizes flexibility, stakeholder collaboration, and the incremental delivery of a high-quality learning platform.
