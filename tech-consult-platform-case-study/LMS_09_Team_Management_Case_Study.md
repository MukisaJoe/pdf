# LMS Case Study: Chapter 9 - Managing Technical Projects and Teams

## 9.1 Project Team Roles and Responsibilities

Building a high-quality LMS requires a blend of technical, design, and operational expertise. The core project team for the "Emerging Tech LMS" will be composed of the following roles:

-   **Project Manager (serving as Scrum Master):** Oversees the project's schedule, budget, and resources. As Scrum Master, they facilitate the agile process and remove impediments for the team.
-   **Product Owner:** Owns the product vision and the product backlog. They are the voice of the student and other stakeholders, ensuring the team builds a valuable and engaging product.
-   **UI/UX Designer:** Leads the design of the learning experience, ensuring the platform is intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing.
-   **Backend Developers (2):** Responsible for building the Django REST API, the database schema (PostgreSQL), and the business logic for courses, quizzes, and user management.
-   **Frontend Developers (2):** Responsible for building the interactive React application, including the course catalog, video player interface, and user dashboards.
-   **QA Engineer:** Responsible for the overall quality of the platform, including creating and executing test plans, and managing the bug tracking process.
-   **DevOps Engineer:** A specialized role responsible for managing the AWS cloud infrastructure, setting up the CI/CD pipeline, and ensuring the video storage and delivery pipeline is robust and scalable.

## 9.2 Team Structure and Collaboration

The technical members (developers, designer, QA, DevOps) will form a single, cohesive **Scrum Team**. This ensures tight integration and a shared sense of ownership.

A critical aspect of this project is the collaboration between the **Scrum Team** and the **Content Creation Team** (who are treated as key external stakeholders). The Product Owner will be the primary bridge between these two groups to ensure the platform's features support the pedagogical goals of the content.

## 9.3 Communication Plan

A formal communication plan ensures that information flows efficiently within the team and to all stakeholders.

| Communication Event | Purpose | Frequency | Audience | Channel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Daily Scrum** | Sync on daily progress and identify blockers. | Daily | Scrum Team | Video Stand-up |
| **Sprint Planning** | Plan the work for the upcoming 3-week sprint. | Every 3 weeks | Scrum Team | Meeting |

| **Team Chat** | For all informal, ad-hoc technical and project discussions. | Continuous | Scrum Team | Slack |

This communication structure is designed to support the agile development of a complex technical product while maintaining strong alignment with parallel teams and external stakeholders.
