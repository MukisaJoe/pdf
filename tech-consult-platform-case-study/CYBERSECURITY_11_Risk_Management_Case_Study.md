# Cybersecurity Case Study: Chapter 11 - Risk Management

## 11.1 Approach to Risk Management

For "Project Sentinel," risk management is the most critical project management function. The potential for an autonomous system to cause operational disruption is significant. Our approach is one of extreme caution, continuous assessment, and direct oversight from the CISO and IT leadership. The Risk Register is a living document reviewed weekly.

## 11.2 Risk Register

This register highlights the most severe and unique risks associated with deploying an autonomous security system.

| ID | Risk Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Response Strategy |
|----|------------------|----------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| **R01** | **False Positive Causes Outage:** The AI agent incorrectly flags a mission-critical production server as malicious and quarantines it, causing a major business outage. | **Operational** | **Medium** | **Critical** | **Mitigate:** 1) Set an extremely low target for the False Positive Rate (<0.1%). 2) Implement a "human-in-the-loop" approval step for any action on a pre-defined list of critical systems. 3) Deploy in "monitor-only" mode for an extended period to build confidence before enabling automated response. 4) Develop a rapid rollback/un-quarantine procedure. |
| **R02** | **Model Evasion:** A sophisticated attacker analyzes our system's behavior and develops a new data exfiltration technique that bypasses our AI model's detection capabilities (a "false negative"). | **Security** | **Medium** | **High** | **Mitigate:** 1) The model will be continuously retrained with new data. 2) Employ a dedicated Red Team to constantly perform adversarial testing and try to find blind spots. 3) Do not rely solely on this system; it is one layer in a defense-in-depth strategy. |
| **R03** | **Agent Compromise:** An attacker gains control of a Sentinel agent, using its credentials and network access to further infiltrate our systems. | **Security** | **Low** | **Critical** | **Avoid/Mitigate:** 1) Harden the agent software itself against tampering. 2) Enforce the Principle of Least Privilege: agents have the absolute minimum permissions needed. 3) Use mTLS for all agent communication and have a robust credential rotation system. 4) Monitor the agents themselves for anomalous behavior. |
| **R04** | **R&D Failure:** The research team is unable to develop a model that meets the minimum required accuracy and false-positive rate within the project's timeline and budget. | **Project / Technical** | **Medium** | **High** | **Mitigate:** 1) Structure the research phase into a series of smaller, iterative experiments with clear go/no-go decision points. 2) Pursue multiple model architectures in parallel during the initial research phase. 3) Fail fast: if a research path isn't promising, pivot quickly. |
| **R05** | **Data Poisoning:** An attacker subtly injects malicious data into the training data pipeline over a long period, slowly degrading the model's accuracy and creating a future vulnerability. | **Security / Data** | **Low** | **High** | **Mitigate:** 1) Implement strong data integrity and anomaly detection checks on all incoming training data. 2) Keep all training datasets in a secure, immutable data store. 3) Periodically retrain the model from scratch using a "golden" trusted dataset to reset any potential poisoning. |
| **R06** | **Unforeseen Action:** The system takes a technically "correct" action that has unforeseen negative business or legal consequences. | **Operational / Legal** | **Low** | **High** | **Mitigate:** 1) The initial scope of automated actions is extremely limited (quarantine only). 2) All automated actions are reviewed by the SOC team and a cross-functional ethics/legal committee before being approved for deployment. 3) Maintain a clear and rapid path for human override. |

## 11.3 Risk Monitoring & Governance

A dedicated risk review meeting will be held every two weeks with the Project Manager, Product Owner, and technical leads. Any risk with a "High" or "Critical" impact will be on the agenda for the monthly CISO Stakeholder Briefing until it is mitigated or formally accepted.
