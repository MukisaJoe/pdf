# App Builder Case Study: Chapter 11 - Risk Management

## 11.1 Approach to Risk Management

For "Project Fusion," the risk management process is focused on the dual challenge of building a sophisticated AI-powered platform while ensuring it is simple enough for non-technical users. Our approach is to identify these unique risks early and build our project plan around mitigating them. The Risk Register is reviewed bi-weekly.

## 11.2 Risk Register

This register documents the most significant risks to the App Builder project.

| ID | Risk Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Response Strategy |
|----|------------------|----------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| **R01** | **Poor User Experience:** The final product is technically functional but too complex or confusing for the target non-technical users, leading to low adoption and project failure. | **Product / UX** | **High** | **Critical** | **Mitigate:** This is the primary risk. Mitigation is central to the project plan: 1) A dedicated UX Designer on the team. 2) Mandatory, bi-weekly hands-on workshops with the pilot user group. 3) Use the System Usability Scale (SUS) as a key project KPI. |
| **R02** | **Inaccurate AI Model:** The AI service for converting natural language "vibes" into data schemas is unreliable or produces nonsensical results, causing user frustration. | **Technical / AI** | **Medium** | **High** | **Mitigate:** 1) Tightly scope the AI's job to only simple schema generation for the MVP. 2) Develop a robust fine-tuning and testing dataset for the LLM. 3) Design the UI so the user can easily review and correct the AI's suggestions, keeping the human in the loop. |
| **R03** | **Poor Quality Generated Code:** The platform generates applications that are buggy, insecure, or unmaintainable, creating widespread technical debt. | **Technical / Quality** | **Medium** | **High** | **Mitigate:** Implement the "Meta-Testing" strategy defined in Chapter 10, where all code templates are automatically tested to ensure they produce high-quality output. All generated code must pass security scans by default. |
| **R04** | **"Shadow IT" Governance Risk:** The tool becomes very popular, and business units create hundreds of undocumented, unsupported, "mission-critical" applications, creating a massive new governance headache for IT. | **Business / Governance** | **Medium** | **High** | **Mitigate:** 1) Involve the central IT governance team in the project from the start. 2) Build an Administrator Dashboard with an inventory of all created apps. 3) Create a clear policy on the *intended use* of the tool (i.e., for simple, non-critical internal processes only). |
| **R05** | **Scope Creep from Pilot Users:** The pilot users, excited by the tool's potential, consistently request features beyond the MVP scope (e.g., workflows, permissions, integrations). | **Scope / Schedule** | **High** | **Medium** | **Mitigate:** The Product Owner will maintain a strict "Out-of-Scope" list for the MVP and manage expectations with the pilot group. All new ideas will be celebrated and added to a V2.0 backlog, but not added to the current project. |
| **R06** | **Uncontrolled Hosting Costs:** The cost of hosting a large number of generated applications on the cloud infrastructure exceeds the planned budget. | **Budget / Operations** | **Medium** | **Medium** | **Mitigate:** 1) Build resource monitoring into the Platform Administrator dashboard from day one. 2) Implement automated "sleep" policies for applications that are not used for an extended period. 3) Set clear quotas for the number of apps a department can create during the pilot. |

## 11.3 Risk Monitoring

The Project Manager owns the Risk Register. The top risks, especially R01 (Poor UX), will be the first topic of every Sprint Retrospective and a key section in the monthly Steering Committee Update.
