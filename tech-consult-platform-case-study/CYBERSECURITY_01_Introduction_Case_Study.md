# Cybersecurity Case Study: Chapter 1 - Introduction to Project Sentinel

## 1.1 Project Definition

**Project Sentinel** is a strategic initiative to develop and deploy a system of **Autonomous Cybersecurity Agents**. This project is a temporary, high-risk, high-reward endeavor aimed at creating a unique, real-time threat detection and response capability for our enterprise systems. The project's lifecycle begins with this initial design and research phase and will conclude when a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) agent system is successfully deployed and demonstrably reduces security response times.

## 1.2 Project Characteristics

-   **Defined Scope (MVP):** The initial deployment will focus on a single, well-defined use case: **detecting and quarantining anomalous network traffic patterns consistent with data exfiltration attempts within our primary AWS cloud environment.** The system will consist of data collection agents, a central analysis engine, and response agents. Out-of-scope for the MVP are other threat types (e.g., malware, phishing) and other environments (e.g., on-premise data centers).
-   **Specific Timeline:** The target for the MVP deployment is **12 months**. This extended timeline accounts for the significant Research and Development (R&D) required.
-   **Set Budget:** The project has an R&D budget of **$750,000**, allocated for a specialized team and significant computational resources for model training.
-   **Unique Goal:** To fundamentally shift our security posture from reactive to proactive and autonomous. The primary goal is to **reduce the Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) for the target threat by over 90%**.

## 1.3 Project Management Application

Given the high degree of technical uncertainty, this project will require a highly adaptive and rigorous application of project management principles. The focus will be on:
-   **Managing Research & Experimentation:** Structuring the R&D phase into clear, time-boxed experiments with defined learning goals.
-   **Establishing Clear Objectives:** Defining precise, measurable performance targets for the AI models (e.g., "achieve a false positive rate below 0.1%").
-   **Balancing Innovation with Control:** Providing the data science and security research team with the freedom to innovate while maintaining clear alignment with the project's strategic goals and constraints.
-   **Managing Stakeholders:** Maintaining constant communication with the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), IT leadership, and legal teams.

## 1.4 The Role of the Project Manager

The Project Manager for Project Sentinel will act as a facilitator and a buffer for a highly specialized technical team. Their key responsibilities will include managing the experimental roadmap, securing computational resources, shielding the team from organizational distractions, and translating technical progress and risks into clear business terms for stakeholders.

## 1.5 The Project Management Lifecycle

Project Sentinel will follow a modified five-phase lifecycle:
1.  **Initiation:** This current phase of defining the project's feasibility and high-level goals.
2.  **Research & Planning:** A dedicated phase for deep research and detailed planning of the experimental roadmap.
3.  **Iterative Execution (Sprints):** A series of development and experimentation sprints focused on data collection, model training, agent development, and simulated testing.
4.  **Monitoring & Controlling:** Continuously tracking the performance of the AI models and the progress of the research against the project's core objectives.
5.  **Deployment & Closing:** A carefully managed deployment into the production environment, followed by a handover to the Security Operations Center (SOC) and a thorough project review.

This structured yet adaptive approach is essential to navigate the inherent uncertainties of a cutting-edge AI development project.
