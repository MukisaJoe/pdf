# Case Study: Chapter 4 - Project Execution and Monitoring

## 4.1 Executing the Project Plan

The execution of the Tech Consult Platform project will be managed through a series of 2-week sprints, as defined by our Scrum methodology. The Project Manager will be responsible for:
-   **Directing and Managing Project Work:** Facilitating the Scrum ceremonies (Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Reviews, and Retrospectives) and ensuring the development team has everything they need to meet their sprint goals.
-   **Managing Stakeholder Engagement:** Providing regular progress updates to investors and other key stakeholders, and managing expectations.
-   **Developing the Project Team:** Fostering a collaborative and productive environment, and providing opportunities for skill development.

## 4.2 Monitoring and Controlling the Project

Continuous monitoring is crucial to keep the project on track. We will use a combination of tools and processes to monitor progress against the project plan.

-   **Tracking Progress:** We will use a project management tool (like Jira or Trello) to manage the product and sprint backlogs. A burndown chart will be used to track the progress of each sprint.
-   **Identifying Variances:** The Daily Scrum will be the primary forum for identifying any immediate blockers or variances from the sprint plan. The Sprint Review will be used to assess whether the sprint goal was met.
-   **Implementing Corrective Actions:** The Sprint Retrospective will be a key process for identifying areas for improvement and implementing corrective actions in the next sprint.
-   **Managing Changes:** Changes to the project scope will be managed through a formal change request process. The Product Owner will be responsible for evaluating the impact of any changes on the timeline and budget and communicating this to stakeholders.

## 4.3 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

We will track KPIs to measure both the project's health during development and the platform's success after launch.

### Project Management KPIs (During Development)

-   **Sprint Velocity:** The amount of work the development team can complete in each sprint. This helps with future planning.
-   **Sprint Burndown:** A visual representation of the work remaining in a sprint. This helps to track progress and identify potential roadblocks.
-   **Schedule Variance (SV):** At a milestone level, are we on track with the 6-month timeline?
-   **Cost Variance (CV):** Are we adhering to the $150,000 budget?

### Business KPIs (Post-Launch)

These KPIs will measure the success of the platform in the market.

-   **User Acquisition Rate:** The number of new Clients and Consultants signing up per week/month.
-   **User Activation Rate:** The percentage of new users who complete a key action (e.g., a Client posting their first project, or a Consultant placing their first bid).
-   **Platform Engagement:**
    -   Number of projects posted per week/month.
    -   Number of bids placed per week/month.
    -   Ratio of projects posted to projects successfully filled.
-   **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT):** Measured through user surveys after a project is completed.
-   **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** A measure of user loyalty and willingness to recommend the platform.

By continuously monitoring these KPIs, we can make data-driven decisions to steer the project toward a successful outcome and ensure the platform meets its business objectives.
