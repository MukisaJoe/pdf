# LMS Case Study: Chapter 4 - Project Execution and Monitoring

## 4.1 Executing the Project Plan

The execution of the "Emerging Tech LMS" project will be driven by the 3-week sprint cycle defined in our Scrum methodology. The Project Manager's role during execution is to be a servant-leader, ensuring the Development Team has a clear path to meet their sprint goals. This involves:
-   **Facilitating Scrum Ceremonies:** Guiding the team through Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Reviews, and Retrospectives.
-   **Removing Impediments:** Proactively identifying and resolving any blockers that are slowing down the team.
-   **Managing Resources:** Ensuring the team has the necessary tools, technologies, and support to succeed.
-   **Engaging Stakeholders:** Keeping investors and content creation teams informed of progress and managing their expectations.

## 4.2 Monitoring and Controlling the Project

To ensure the project stays on track, we will employ a robust monitoring and control framework.
-   **Progress Tracking:** We will use a project management tool like **Jira** to manage the product backlog and track the status of all user stories. **Sprint burndown charts** will be used to visualize progress within each sprint.
-   **Quality Monitoring:** The QA Engineer will track metrics such as bug density and test coverage. These will be reviewed during Sprint Retrospectives.
-   **Change Management:** A formal change control process will be implemented. Any significant change request must be submitted to the Product Owner, who will assess its impact on scope, schedule, and budget. The change will only be approved after consultation with key stakeholders.

## 4.3 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

We will track specific KPIs to measure both the efficiency of our project execution and the business success of the final product.

### Project Management KPIs (During Development)

-   **Sprint Velocity:** The average number of story points the team completes per sprint. This is crucial for long-term planning and predictability.
-   **Say/Do Ratio:** The ratio of committed story points vs. completed story points per sprint. This measures the team's reliability.
-   **Cycle Time:** The time it takes for a task to move from "In Progress" to "Done." This helps identify process bottlenecks.
-   **Budget vs. Actuals:** A monthly report tracking the project's spend against the allocated budget.

### Business KPIs (Post-Launch)

These KPIs will define the success of the LMS platform in the market.

-   **Student Enrollment Rate:** The number of new students signing up per month.
-   **Course Completion Rate:** The percentage of enrolled students who successfully complete a course. This is a key indicator of content quality and platform engagement.
-   **Student Satisfaction (CSAT):** A rating (e.g., 1-5 stars) collected at the end of each course.
-   **Platform Uptime:** The percentage of time the LMS is available and operational (Target: 99.9%).
-   **Revenue:** (If applicable) Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) or total course sales.
-   **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** The total revenue a single student is expected to generate.

By continuously monitoring these KPIs, the project team and stakeholders can make informed, data-driven decisions to ensure the "Emerging Tech LMS" is a successful and valuable product.
