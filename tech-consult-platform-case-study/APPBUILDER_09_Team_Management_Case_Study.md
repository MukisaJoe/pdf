# App Builder Case Study: Chapter 9 - Managing Technical Projects and Teams

## 9.1 Project Team Roles and Responsibilities

"Project Fusion" requires a highly collaborative, product-focused team with deep expertise in AI, user experience (UX), and software engineering.

-   **Project Manager:** Responsible for the overall project governance, including budget, schedule, and reporting to the steering committee.
-   **Product Owner:** The champion of the non-technical user. This role is responsible for the product vision, defining requirements through user stories, and relentlessly prioritizing features that improve ease of use and deliver value to the App Creators.
-   **Scrum Master:** The facilitator of the Scrum process, responsible for removing impediments and fostering a high-performing team environment.
-   **AI/ML Engineer (2):** A specialized pair of engineers focused on building and fine-tuning the "AI Core Service" that translates natural language into structured data schemas.
-   **Backend Engineer (2):** Responsible for building the microservices for backend code generation, frontend code generation, and automated deployment.
-   **Frontend Engineer (2):** Responsible for building and refining the "Fusion Studio," the main web interface that users interact with.
-   **UX Designer:** A critical, full-time role dedicated to researching user needs, designing the app creation workflow, and conducting usability tests. They work side-by-side with the frontend engineers.
-   **QA Engineer:** Responsible for the end-to-end quality of the Fusion platform itself, ensuring the generation pipeline is reliable and the user experience is bug-free.

## 9.2 Team Structure

The entire project team will operate as a **single, co-located Scrum Team**. This structure is chosen deliberately to maximize collaboration, especially between the UX Designer, the AI Engineers, and the Frontend Engineers. The constant, informal communication in a co-located team is essential for solving the core challenge of this project: making a complex system feel simple.

The team's success depends on a shared obsession with the user's experience.

## 9.3 Communication Plan

Our communication plan is designed to be lean and effective, with a strong emphasis on direct interaction with our pilot users.

| Communication Event | Purpose | Frequency | Audience | Channel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Daily Scrum** | Sync on progress, plan the day, raise blockers. | Daily | Entire Scrum Team | In-person Stand-up |
| **Sprint Planning** | Plan the work for the upcoming 2-week sprint. | Every 2 weeks | Entire Scrum Team | Meeting |
| **Backlog Refinement** | Prepare and estimate user stories for future sprints. | Weekly | Entire Scrum Team | Meeting |
| **Pilot User Workshop** | **CRITICAL:** A hands-on session, not a demo. Pilot users try to build apps with the latest increment, while the dev team observes and asks questions. | Every 2 weeks (replaces a traditional Sprint Review) | Entire Scrum Team, Pilot User Group | Workshop |
| **Sprint Retrospective** | Reflect on and improve the team's process and collaboration. | Every 2 weeks | Entire Scrum Team | Meeting |
| **Steering Committee Update** | Report on progress, budget, and key findings from the pilot program. | Monthly | PM, PO, Project Sponsors | Presentation |
| **Team Chat** | For all day-to-day informal communication. | Continuous | Entire Scrum Team | Slack |

The centerpiece of this plan is the **Pilot User Workshop**. This is where the team gets its most valuable feedback and ensures the project stays aligned with its primary goal of user empowerment.
