# LMS Case Study: Chapter 8 - High-Level System Architecture Design

## 8.1 Architectural Goals

The architecture for the "Emerging Tech LMS" is designed to meet the specific demands of a media-rich educational platform. The key architectural drivers are:
-   **Reliability:** The platform must be highly available, especially during video playback.
-   **Performance:** Video streaming must be fast and smooth, and the application must be responsive.
-   **Scalability:** The architecture must handle growth in users, courses, and concurrent video streams.
-   **Security:** Student data and premium course content must be protected.
-   **Maintainability:** The system must be easy to update and extend with new features.

## 8.2 Architectural Pattern: Decoupled Monolith

For the V1.0 launch, we will use a **Decoupled Monolithic** architecture. The backend will be built as a single, cohesive Django application to manage all business logic, while the frontend will be a completely separate React SPA.

**Justification:**
This pattern offers the best balance of development speed and architectural soundness for our initial product. A monolith is simpler to build, test, and deploy than a distributed microservices architecture, which is a significant advantage for meeting our 9-month timeline. The clear separation between the frontend and backend still allows our teams to work independently and creates a clean, maintainable structure that can be evolved into microservices in the future if a component (like the quiz or notification service) requires independent scaling.

## 8.3 Technology Stack

-   **Frontend:** **React**. Its component-based architecture is ideal for building a complex, interactive UI like a course player and dashboard. Its large ecosystem provides access to mature libraries for state management and UI components.
-   **Backend:** **Python** with **Django** and **Django REST Framework (DRF)**. Django's robust framework will accelerate the development of features like user management and course administration. DRF will be used to create a secure and well-structured REST API for the frontend.
-   **Database:** **PostgreSQL**. As specified, we will use PostgreSQL. This is an excellent choice, known for its proven reliability, support for complex queries, and strong data integrity, all of which are critical for managing student progress and course information.
-   **Video Storage & Delivery:**
    -   **Storage:** Raw video files will be stored in a cloud object store like **Amazon S3**.
    -   **Delivery:** A **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**, such as **Amazon CloudFront**, will be used to cache and deliver video content to users globally. This ensures low-latency, high-performance streaming.
-   **Deployment:** The entire application will be **containerized using Docker**. This provides a consistent and reproducible environment for development and deployment. The containers will be deployed on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, leveraging services like Elastic Container Service (ECS) for the application and RDS for the managed PostgreSQL database.

## 8.4 High-Level Data & Media Flow

1.  An administrator uploads a high-resolution video to the LMS backend.
2.  The backend saves the video file to **Amazon S3** and triggers a transcoding process (e.g., using AWS Elemental MediaConvert) to create multiple versions at different bitrates for adaptive streaming.
3.  A student requests to watch a video from the **React Frontend**.
4.  The frontend calls the **Django Backend** API to get the video information.
5.  The backend generates a secure, time-limited URL pointing to the video manifest file on the **CDN**.
6.  The frontend uses this URL to stream the video directly and securely from the CDN, providing a fast, smooth playback experience.

This architecture provides a robust and scalable foundation for building a world-class e-learning platform.
