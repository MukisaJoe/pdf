# App Builder Case Study: Chapter 8 - High-Level System Architecture

## 8.1 Architectural Goals

The architecture for "Project Fusion" is designed to manage the complexity of a code-generation platform. The primary goals are:
-   **Extensibility:** The architecture must make it easy to add new features, such as generating apps with different front-end frameworks (e.g., Vue.js) or for different targets (e.g., mobile apps).
-   **Maintainability:** Each complex part of the system (AI, backend generation, frontend generation) must be an independent, self-contained service that can be worked on without impacting the others.
-   **Scalability & Resilience:** The platform must be able to handle many users building applications simultaneously, and a failure in one part of the generation pipeline (e.g., the frontend generator) should not bring down the entire system.

## 8.2 Architectural Pattern: Orchestrated Microservices

To meet these goals, we will use an **Orchestrated Microservices Architecture**. The system is broken down into a suite of specialized, single-purpose services. A central **Orchestration API** acts as a "conductor," managing the workflow by making calls to the different services in the correct sequence to build an application.

**Justification:**
A monolithic application would be unsuitable, as the different parts of the system have vastly different technical needs and scaling properties. For example, the AI service is computationally intensive, while the code generation services are template-heavy. Microservices allow us to use the best technology for each job and to scale each service independently. The orchestration pattern (as opposed to a purely event-driven choreography) is chosen to provide a clear, manageable, and traceable workflow for the complex, multi-step process of building an app.

## 8.3 Technology Stack & Service Breakdown

-   **Fusion Studio (Frontend):** A **React** SPA that provides the user interface for the app builder.
-   **Orchestration API (Gateway):** A **Node.js/Express.js** service that provides the main REST API for the studio. It is responsible for orchestrating the calls to the other backend services.
-   **AI Core Service:** A **Python** service using **FastAPI**. It interfaces with a fine-tuned LLM (e.g., from Hugging Face) to perform the natural language processing and schema suggestion.
-   **Backend Generation Service:** A **Python** service that contains a set of **Jinja2** templates for creating Django models, views, and serializers. When given a JSON schema from the Orchestration API, it generates a full Django project source code.
-   **Frontend Generation Service:** A **Node.js** service that contains a set of templates for creating React components, services, and views. When given a JSON schema, it generates a full React project source code.
-   **Deployment Service:** A **Go** service that takes the generated source code, creates a Dockerfile for it, builds a container image, and pushes it to our container registry (e.g., AWS ECR), and then deploys it to our **Kubernetes** cluster (AWS EKS).
-   **Platform Database:** **PostgreSQL**, used by the Orchestration API to store user data and metadata about the generated applications.

## 8.4 Key Architectural Concepts

-   **Template-Based Generation:** The code generation services do not "write" code in an intelligent way. They contain highly structured templates of a "perfect" application. The services receive a schema (e.g., for a "Laptop" object) and use it as a set of variables to fill in the blanks in these templates, producing the final source code files.
-   **Secure Multi-Tenancy:** The Deployment Service is responsible for ensuring that each generated application is deployed into its own isolated namespace within the Kubernetes cluster, with its own database schema and network policies. This is critical to ensure that one generated app cannot interfere with or access the data of another.

This microservices architecture provides the flexibility and separation of concerns needed to build and maintain such a complex and powerful internal tool.
